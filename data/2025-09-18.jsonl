We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data.

To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT.

APFEx combines\nthree key innovations- (1) an adaptive multi-objective optimizer that\ndynamically switches between Pareto cone projection, gradient weighting, and\nexploration strategies to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, (2)\ndifferentiable intersectional fairness metrics enabling gradient-based\noptimization of non-smooth subgroup disparities, and (3) theoretical guarantees\nof convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions.

Drawing on\ninterdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of\nhallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions:\noutputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial\nproxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and\nsurface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness. This encourages\npassive user trust in outputs that appear accurate but epistemically untenable.\nSecond, accuracy as a singular metric fails to detect harms that are not\nfactually false but are nonetheless misleading, value-laden, or socially\ndistorting, including consensus illusions, sycophantic alignment, and subtle\nmanipulation. Third, regulatory overemphasis on accuracy obscures the wider\nsocietal consequences of hallucination, including social sorting, privacy\nviolations, equity harms, epistemic convergence that marginalises dissent,\nreduces pluralism, and causes social deskilling. By examining the EU AI Act,\nGDPR, and DSA, the article argues that current regulations are not yet\nstructurally equipped to address these epistemic, relational, and systemic\nharms and exacerbated by the overreliance on accuracy.

We evaluate CogniAlign on classic and novel\nmoral questions and compare its outputs against GPT-4o using a five-part\nethical audit framework. Results show that CogniAlign consistently outperforms\nthe baseline across more than sixty moral questions, with average performance\ngains of 16.2 points in analytic quality, 14.3 points in breadth, and 28.4\npoints in depth of explanation. In the Heinz dilemma, for example, CogniAlign\nachieved an overall score of 89.2 compared to GPT-4o's 69.2, demonstrating a\ndecisive advantage in handling moral reasoning. By reducing black-box reasoning\nand avoiding deceptive alignment, CogniAlign highlights the potential of\ninterdisciplinary deliberation as a scalable pathway for safe and transparent\nAI alignment."}

To\nbridge this gap, we first analyze the performance and efficiency of three SOTA\ntools, spanning both pipeline-based and agentic architectures, in automated\nissue solving tasks of SWE-Bench-Verified under varying task characteristics.\nFurthermore, to move from high-level performance metrics to underlying cause\nanalysis, we conducted a systematic manual analysis of 150 failed instances.\nFrom this analysis, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes\ncomprising 3 primary phases, 9 main categories, and 25 fine-grained\nsubcategories. Then we systematically analyze the distribution of the\nidentified failure modes, the results reveal distinct failure fingerprints\nbetween the two architectural paradigms, with the majority of agentic failures\nstemming from flawed reasoning and cognitive deadlocks. Motivated by these\ninsights, we propose a collaborative Expert-Executor framework. It introduces a\nsupervisory Expert agent tasked with providing strategic oversight and\ncourse-correction for a primary Executor agent. This architecture is designed\nto correct flawed reasoning and break the cognitive deadlocks that frequently\nlead to failure. Experiments show that our framework solves 22.2% of previously\nintractable issues for a leading single agent. These findings pave the way for\nbuilding more robust agents through diagnostic evaluation and collaborative\ndesign."}

Simultaneously, numerous\nrecent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting,\ndebt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines\nthat incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected\nfinancial returns. In this study, we introduce a novel and reproducible\nframework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance\nstudies to construct supervision data for end-to-end advisors. Using this\nframework, we create a 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct a comprehensive\nfine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through a held-out test\nsplit and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data\ncuration and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance\ncomparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual\naccuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs\nthan the larger counterparts."}

Existing theory hypothesizes that\nsecond-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning\n(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such\nenvironment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this\nhypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a\nsecond-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions\nof optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's\nparameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We\ndemonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the\ncognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the\nenvironment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant\nperformance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks,\nproviding empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental\nrepresentations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning."}

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

The average-reward\nformulation, while natural in many operations research and management contexts,\nremains underexplored. This is primarily because the dynamic programming\nfoundations are technically challenging and only partially understood, with\nseveral fundamental questions remaining open. This paper steps toward a general\nframework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain\nsetting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible\ninformation asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary.\nOur analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining\nboth the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average\nreward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation\ncharacterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide\nsufficient conditions ensuring solutions' existence.

The flow dynamics can be time-varying\nand chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and\ncomplex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model\nand predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes\nthat drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally\nintensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is\nlimited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source\nlocalization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element\nmodel of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are\nused to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an\ninfotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to\nmaximize informativeness for the source localization objective.

Based on the analysis of the\nsolution path of the fused lasso using a LARS-type algorithm, we derive exact\nconditional $p$-values for the selected change-points.
