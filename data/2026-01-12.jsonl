We find that foreign investor predictive power increases 8.9-fold during crisis periods relative to bull markets ($β_{crisis}=0.00204$ vs. $β_{bull}=0.00023$), while individual investors exhibit momentum-chasing behavior with 6.3 times stronger response to positive shocks.

Parametric models with fixed nominal parameters often omit critical physical effects due to simplifications in geometry, material behavior, damping, or boundary conditions, resulting in model form errors (MFEs) that impair predictive accuracy. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for MFE estimation and correction in high-dimensional finite element (FE) based structural dynamical systems. The Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) represents discrepancies non-parametrically in the reduced modal domain, allowing a flexible data-driven characterization of unmodeled dynamics. A linear Bayesian filtering approach jointly estimates system states and discrepancies, incorporating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure computational tractability, the FE system is projected onto a reduced modal basis, and a mesh-invariant neural network maps modal states to discrepancy estimates, permitting model rectification across different FE discretizations without retraining. Validation is undertaken across five MFE scenarios-including incorrect beam theory, damping misspecification, misspecified boundary condition, unmodeled material nonlinearity, and local damage demonstrating the surrogate model's substantial reduction of displacement and rotation prediction errors under unseen excitations. The proposed methodology offers a potential means to uphold digital twin accuracy amid inherent modeling uncertainties."}

MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks."}

Existing conditional inference methods lack this flexibility as they are tied to a fixed conditioning structure and cannot perform new conditional inference once trained. To solve this, we propose a Bayesian generative modeling (BGM) approach for arbitrary conditional inference without retraining. BGM learns a generative model of X through an iterative Bayesian updating algorithm where model parameters and latent variables are updated until convergence. Once trained, any conditional distribution can be obtained without retraining. Empirically, BGM achieves superior prediction performance with well calibrated predictive intervals, demonstrating that a single learned model can serve as a universal engine for conditional prediction with uncertainty quantification. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic iterative algorithm, statistical consistency and conditional-risk bounds. The proposed BGM framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex relationships among variables while adhering to Bayesian principles, emerging as a promising framework for advancing various applications in modern data science.

Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply.

We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity.

We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees."}

Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone."}

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness."}

To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs."}

Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\\varepsilon)=N_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales."}

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management."}

Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $Γ$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets.

We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees."}

A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search. This framework establishes a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, with direct relevance to GP modeling and deep kernel learning."}

Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation."}

A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erdős--Rényi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities."}

Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone."}

We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks."}

Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations.

We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. Furthermore, a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor leverages attention entropy to adaptively trigger consolidation only when high epistemic uncertainty is detected.

Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels.

While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation."}

We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse.

Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters."}

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery."}

We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle.

To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively."}

DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous \"ragged filtration\" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s \"CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Winter\" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment. Ablation studies confirm that strictly lagged cross-sectional attention, graph prior, principled treatment of transaction costs, and robust minimax optimization are the primary drivers of this generalization capability."}

In this study, we introduce the Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark, which includes essays integrating sensitive topics such as racism and gender bias, to test the efficacy of various LLMs in recognizing and scoring harmful content. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs require further enhancement to accurately distinguish between harmful and argumentative essays, and (2) both current AES models and LLMs fail to consider the ethical dimensions of content during scoring.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\\textbf{Hi}erarchical \\textbf{Z}eroth- and \\textbf{F}irst-\\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of \"beneficial stochasticity\" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning."}

Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention.

While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification.

These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management."}

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency."}

In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit \"OR\" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit \"AND\" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks.

In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian.

Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system.

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model.

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions."}

This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit \"OR\" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit \"AND\" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks. The framework and implementation are publicly available."}

While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior."}

Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens.

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity.

The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $ε> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/ε^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $ε$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/ε)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples. Our work highlights the fundamental distinction between treatment effect estimation and treatment allocation: the latter requires far fewer samples."}

However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update. Across seven challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, experiments on both dense and MoE models from the Qwen3 series show that DHPO consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO.

During the first stage, a multi-turn dialogue strategy guides the model to generate CoT data incorporating verification, backtracking, subgoal decomposition, and backward reasoning, with predefined rules filtering high-quality samples for supervised fine-tuning. The second stage employs a difficulty-aware rejection sampling mechanism to dynamically optimize data distribution, strengthening the model's ability to handle complex problems. The approach generates reasoning chains extended over 4 times longer while maintaining strong scalability, proving that SFT effectively activates models' intrinsic reasoning capabilities and provides a resource-efficient pathway for complex task optimization.

On Pretraining Romanized Encoder Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost."}

Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models."}

However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences."}

This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning."}

On Pretraining Romanized Encoder Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost."}

Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves."}

AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function.

We first compare few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels. We then generate \"steered\" summaries under FAITHFUL, CENTRIST, LEFT, and RIGHT prompts, and score all outputs using a single fixed ideology evaluator. We find pervasive ideological center-collapse in both article-level ratings and generated text, indicating a systematic tendency toward centrist framing.

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability."}

Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default."}

Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models."}

The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy.

Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix).

We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings."}

The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics."}

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures."}

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk."}

Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows."}

Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility."}

However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems."}

We further introduce \\textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks.

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance.

However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems."}

However, the increasing volume of user-generated reviews has led to information overload, making it difficult for consumers to identify content that aligns with their specific preferences.

This research addresses these limitations by proposing a personalized framework that integrates review ranking and abstractive summarization to enhance decision-making efficiency. The proposed system begins by modeling each user's sentiment through a hybrid analysis of star ratings and review content. Simultaneously, user preferences were derived from historical reviews using sentence embeddings and clustering, forming semantic profiles aligned with thematic and sentiment dimensions. A relevance scoring algorithm matched these profiles with unseen reviews based on sentiment and aspect similarity. Top-matched reviews were then summarized to reflect individual interests. A user study with 70 participants demonstrated that the personalized approach improved satisfaction, perceived relevance, and decision-making confidence, while reducing time spent reading. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in alleviating information overload and delivering content tailored to user-specific preferences, emphasizing its value in enhancing user experience in review-rich decision-making environments."}

A key gap in current RAG evaluation is the lack of a metric to quantify the contribution of individual retrieved documents to the final output. To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents. These results confirm the efficacy of IS in isolating and quantifying document influence, offering a valuable tool for improving the transparency and reliability of RAG systems."}

While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically study illustrations at a large scale remains challenging. Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations. This scale of processing in under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforms traditional segmentation techniques in both efficiency and accessibility for visual scholarship. Our work demonstrates how cutting-edge AI tools can profoundly reshape scholarly workflows and open new avenues for multidisciplinary research in the age of digital manuscripts."}

While machine learning has shown promise in this domain, many reported results suffer from methodological flaws, most notably patient level data leakage, inflating performance estimates and limiting clinical translation. To address these modeling pitfalls, we propose a unified evaluation framework grounded in nested cross validation and incorporating three complementary safeguards: (i) patient level stratification to eliminate subject overlap and ensure unbiased generalization, (ii) multi layered windowing to harmonize heterogeneous EEG recordings while preserving temporal dynamics, and (iii) inner loop channel selection to enable principled feature reduction without information leakage. Applied across three independent datasets with a heterogeneous number of channels, a convolutional neural network trained under this framework achieved 80.6% accuracy and demonstrated state of the art performance under held out population block testing, comparable to other methods in the literature. This performance underscores the necessity of nested cross validation as a safeguard against bias and as a principled means of selecting the most relevant information for patient level decisions, providing a reproducible foundation that can extend to other biomedical signal analysis domains."}

This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments."}

We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning.

To ensure computational tractability, the FE system is projected onto a reduced modal basis, and a mesh-invariant neural network maps modal states to discrepancy estimates, permitting model rectification across different FE discretizations without retraining. Validation is undertaken across five MFE scenarios-including incorrect beam theory, damping misspecification, misspecified boundary condition, unmodeled material nonlinearity, and local damage demonstrating the surrogate model's substantial reduction of displacement and rotation prediction errors under unseen excitations. The proposed methodology offers a potential means to uphold digital twin accuracy amid inherent modeling uncertainties."}

This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments."}

This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data."}

To solve this, we propose a Bayesian generative modeling (BGM) approach for arbitrary conditional inference without retraining. BGM learns a generative model of X through an iterative Bayesian updating algorithm where model parameters and latent variables are updated until convergence. Once trained, any conditional distribution can be obtained without retraining. Empirically, BGM achieves superior prediction performance with well calibrated predictive intervals, demonstrating that a single learned model can serve as a universal engine for conditional prediction with uncertainty quantification. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic iterative algorithm, statistical consistency and conditional-risk bounds.

Therefore, we launched the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) at ICASSP 2026 to benchmark these dual capabilities.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mastermind, a multi-turn jailbreak framework that adopts a dynamic and self-improving approach. Mastermind operates in a closed loop of planning, execution, and reflection, enabling it to autonomously build and refine its knowledge of model vulnerabilities through interaction. It employs a hierarchical planning architecture that decouples high-level attack objectives from low-level tactical execution, ensuring long-term focus and coherence. This planning is guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously discovers and refines effective attack patterns by reflecting on interactive experiences. Mastermind leverages this accumulated knowledge to dynamically recombine and adapt attack vectors, dramatically improving both effectiveness and resilience. We conduct comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The results demonstrate that Mastermind significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantially higher attack success rates and harmfulness ratings. Moreover, our framework exhibits notable resilience against multiple advanced defense mechanisms."}

An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks.

Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains.

Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid \"ground truth\" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery."}

By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation.

Overlapping k-mer tokenization can introduce information leakage under masked language modeling (MLM) and may degrade downstream accuracy. Single-nucleotide tokenization avoids leakage and preserves per-base fidelity, but it greatly increases sequence length for attention-based architectures. Non-overlapping k-mers and byte-pair encoding (BPE) provide compression and avoid leakage, at the cost of boundary sensitivity or reduced interpretability. Empirically, the choice of tokenization interacts strongly with model architecture and task requirements. At the system level, however, standard string tokenizers and host-bound vocabulary lookups dominate wall-clock time once inputs reach billions of bases, regardless of the tokenization algorithm. We present DNATok, a high-performance, GPU-first tokenization system that replaces general-purpose string processing with byte lookup table (LUT)-based identifier streaming and an overlapped host-to-device (H2D)/compute pipeline using pinned memory and architectural parallelism. DNATok is vocabulary-agnostic: it accelerates single-nucleotide, non-overlapping k-mer, and BPE tokenization, and integrates as a drop-in systems layer beneath genomic foundation models. DNATok achieves 84-95x higher encoding throughput than optimized Hugging Face baselines and up to 1.9x higher H2D throughput.

Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning."}

With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures.

The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities.

By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains.

Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders. We then propose SToICaL - a Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss - which can incorporate rank-aware supervision at both the item and token levels within the pointwise setup. We run a suite of experiments on ranking tasks derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ESCI (Reddy et al., arXiv:2206.06588). Two variants of SToICaL successfully suppress the probability of invalid docID generations and improve on common ranking metrics beyond top-1 retrieval."}

Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer."}

To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning."}

Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits."}

In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning.

Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE."}

Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers.

However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions.

This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation.

High-fidelity approaches require repeated forward and adjoint PDE solves inside nested Bayesian inversion and design loops. We formulate SBOED as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and learn an amortized design policy via policy-gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL), enabling online design selection from the experiment history without repeatedly solving an SBOED optimization problem. To make policy training and reward evaluation scalable, we combine dual dimension reduction -- active subspace projection for the parameter and principal component analysis for the state -- with an adjusted derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO) surrogate that predicts both the parameter-to-solution map and its Jacobian. We use a Laplace-based D-optimality reward while noting that, in general, other expected-information-gain utilities such as KL divergence can also be used within the same framework. We further introduce an eigenvalue-based evaluation strategy that uses prior samples as proxies for maximum a posteriori (MAP) points, avoiding repeated MAP solves while retaining accurate information-gain estimates. Numerical experiments on sequential multi-sensor placement for contaminant source tracking demonstrate approximately $100\\times$ speedup over high-fidelity finite element methods, improved performance over random sensor placements, and physically interpretable policies that discover an ``upstream'' tracking strategy."}

We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks.

Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies."}

DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous \"ragged filtration\" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s \"CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Winter\" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment.

However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proactive solution achieves 2-3x higher long-term average revenue under dynamic link conditions, providing a scalable and resilient framework for adaptive admission control."}

Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches."}

Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\\varepsilon)=N_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales."}

Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $Γ$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets. This provides a formalization of mesh and sample independence for the training of such networks."}
