Indeed,\nnegative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted\nto the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate\nquadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs)\nand repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the\nliterature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance.

Our analysis sheds light on\nUnifOrtho's success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large\ndimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature.

With increased model\nscale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B,\nreflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination\nrate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of\nhallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially\nevident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities\n(ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets.\nThese findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models,\npointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such\ninputs--regardless of their scale."}

We explore an\nalternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical\nalgorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making\ndomain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents\nthat, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is\nscientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),\nand enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-\nand closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided\nprompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus\nfine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical\nvalidity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and\nguided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on\nboth criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly\nwithout fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from\nfine-tuning.

Despite\nits advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can\naffect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each\ncommunication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and\ntransmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a\nsingle bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining\nbits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit\nwhile maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and\nNon-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves\nsuperior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting\nmodels.

Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining.

We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks.

Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and\nmerging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving\nneuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,\nRecombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert\npruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and\ncontain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for\ndirect merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes\nredundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into\nneuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible\nretained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to\nbuild a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage,\nmaking SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice."}

However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought.

In step 2, Structure extraction, we\nshow how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data,\ncorresponding to a diverse set of meaningful \"intermediate structures\", in a\nzero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes\nthe cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then\ncontinually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and\nprediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both\nallowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control\nhandles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an\ninstance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to\nperform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we\nextract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object\nsegmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive\nimprovements."}

While three-dimensional PACT systems enable high-resolution\nvolumetric imaging for applications spanning transcranial to breast imaging,\ncurrent implementations require dense transducer arrays and prolonged\nacquisition times, limiting clinical translation. We introduce Pano (PACT\nimaging neural operator), an end-to-end physics-aware model that directly\nlearns the inverse acoustic mapping from sensor measurements to volumetric\nreconstructions. Unlike existing approaches (e.g. universal back-projection\nalgorithm), Pano learns both physics and data priors while also being agnostic\nto the input data resolution. Pano employs spherical discrete-continuous\nconvolutions to preserve hemispherical sensor geometry, incorporates Helmholtz\nequation constraints to ensure physical consistency and operates\nresolutionindependently across varying sensor configurations. We demonstrate\nthe robustness and efficiency of Pano in reconstructing high-quality images\nfrom both simulated and real experimental data, achieving consistent\nperformance even with significantly reduced transducer counts and limited-angle\nacquisition configurations.

The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early\ndetection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,\nenvironmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved\ndetection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all\ngrowth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy\nand 95.37 percent recall. These results demonstrate the strong potential of\ntemporal multispectral analysis and LSTM networks for early broomrape\ndetection.

Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and\nlaborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage\nclassification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation\nassociated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth\nrestriction).\n  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal\ncortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG.

The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW)\nhas gained momentum in machine learning either as a proxy to the less\ncomputationally tractable Wasserstein distance, or as a distance in its own\nright, due in particular to its built-in alleviation of the curse of\ndimensionality. There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for\nthe sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on\nquadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed,\nnegative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted\nto the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate\nquadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs)\nand repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the\nliterature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance. We then numerically\nbenchmark these quadratures. Moreover, we analyze the variance of the UnifOrtho\nestimator, an orthogonal Monte Carlo estimator. Our analysis sheds light on\nUnifOrtho's success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large\ndimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature. Our final\nrecommendation for the computation of the sliced Wasserstein distance is to use\nrandomized quasi-Monte Carlo in low dimensions and \\emph{UnifOrtho} in large\ndimensions.

Insights from exact generalisation error", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in learning on graph-structured\ndata, yet a principled understanding of why they succeed or fail remains\nelusive. While prior works have examined architectural limitations such as\nover-smoothing and over-squashing, these do not explain what enables GNNs to\nextract meaningful representations or why performance varies drastically\nbetween similar architectures. These questions are related to the role of\ngeneralisation: the ability of a model to make accurate predictions on\nunlabelled data. Although several works have derived generalisation error\nbounds for GNNs, these are typically loose, restricted to a single\narchitecture, and offer limited insight into what governs generalisation in\npractice. In this work, we take a different approach by deriving the exact\ngeneralisation error for GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting through\nthe lens of signal processing. From this viewpoint, GNNs can be interpreted as\ngraph filter operators that act on node features via the graph structure. By\nfocusing on linear GNNs while allowing non-linearity in the graph filters, we\nderive the first exact generalisation error for a broad range of GNNs,\nincluding convolutional, PageRank-based, and attention-based models. The exact\ncharacterisation of the generalisation error reveals that only the aligned\ninformation between node features and graph structure contributes to\ngeneralisation. Furthermore, we quantify the effect of homophily on\ngeneralisation. Our work provides a framework that explains when and why GNNs\ncan effectively leverage structural and feature information, offering practical\nguidance for model selection."}

The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential\nto be improved with deep learning methods.

Existing mammography VLMs,\nadapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such\nas multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze\nboth views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods\ntreat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view\ncorrespondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in\nsuboptimal prediction.

Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this\nprocess, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners.

DP-CDA\nsynthesizes data in a centralized setting by mixing multiple randomly-selected\nsamples from the same class and injecting carefully calibrated Gaussian noise,\nensuring ({\\epsilon}, {\\delta})-differential privacy. When deployed in a\ndecentralized or federated setting, where each client holds only a small\npartition of the data, DP-CDA faces new challenges. The limited sample size per\nclient increases the sensitivity of local computations, requiring higher noise\ninjection to maintain the differential privacy guarantee.

However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought.
