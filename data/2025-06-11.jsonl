Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual\nbenefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising\nMarkov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice,\nhowever, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,\nsurprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we\nexplain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes\nuse of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov\nprocesses: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed\nrate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in\nthe known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show\nthat we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any\ndiscrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete\ndiffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking\ndiffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate\ninductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that\noutperform masking."}

However, its direct use in training\ndeep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse\nfolding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural\nfeature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical\nregularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the\nconformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the\nProtein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,\nPDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential\nfor generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we\nintroduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct\nnative-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By\ntraining the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly\ncaptures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying\nDeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly\nimprove inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks.

These\nchallenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the\napproach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging\nfunction-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.\nInstead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,\npurpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed\nby invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid\napproach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by\nensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before\ndeployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and\nmaintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist\nin the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on\nvalidation rather than creation.

Existing off-dynamics offline RL\nmethods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the\ntarget domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by\nthe limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the\nlearned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.\nWe propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that\naddresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via\nlearned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target\ndomain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during\noffline policy learning.

Directly merging these\ndatasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY\nlearns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states\nand transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize\ntraining, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the\npolicy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that\nregularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather\nthan uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset.

However, prior work\nhas predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks\nand single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to\ncompositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This\nwork introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile\nagents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,\nContext Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in\n20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online\nChinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates\nwith an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a\nrange of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that\nUI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents\ngenerally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting\nrepresentative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and\nattention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.\nInspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient\nscheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nextrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing\nlong-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nachieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on\ncompositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without\nsignificantly sacrificing inference overhead.

In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL\nframework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient\nreasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length\nreward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,\nand a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for\nhard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments\nacross multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and\nefficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based\nreward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and\nefficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly\nfor efficient reasoning."}

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to\ndynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a\nHybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series\ninto frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with\nmulti-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local\ninformation in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets\nfrom diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms\nmainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational\nefficiency.

These compromised agents can subsequently be\nmanipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific\ntriggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we\npresent ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on\nLLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies\namong the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing\non this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential\nbackdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the\nagent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the\nagent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought\ntrajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and\nthe user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's\neffectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks.
