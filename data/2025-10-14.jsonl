While machine learning\napproaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often\nbeen limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation\nagainst the full spectrum of market conditions.\n  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network\n(DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an\nunprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest\nrate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and\nextreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained\nvia high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled\nshifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without\nany loss of generality.\n  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility\nsurfaces and Caps/Floors prices for any maturity and strike with negligible\ncomputational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results\nfully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a\nsystematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest\nrate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus\nestablishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for\ndaily trading and risk management activities."}

Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,\nachieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents\nbackward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally\nchallenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two\nvariational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.\nIn this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural\nnetwork-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly\nutilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the\nupstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis\nand reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for\nthe upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional\nvariational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional\ncut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all\nthe upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut\nestimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data\nregime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution,\nquantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the\ntarget cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we\nestablish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of\nconditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses\nillustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over\ntraditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than\nparametric variational cut approaches."}

However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm\nrather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the\ntransfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address\nthis challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity\nand provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,\nexisting methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label\ninformation and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical\ntransferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning\nScore (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization\nperformance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by\nestablishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision\nboundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is\nefficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive\ndistribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a\ngeneral framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or\nnegative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error,\nenabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to\nencoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer\npipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or\ndegrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in\ntransfer learning."}

While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by\nreusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by\ndisaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be\nrealized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM\ninference engines and queries.\n  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV\ncaching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM\nengines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.\nLMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming\nLLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV\ncache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both\ncache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode\ndisaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and\nwide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache\ndata movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement\noperations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,\ndecoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class\ncontrol API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for\nflexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.\nEvaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x\nimprovement in throughput across diverse workloads.

This study addresses the\nformation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock\nloading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling\nof EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock\nconditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct\nnumerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional\nNeural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting\nstrong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to\nrapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important\nroles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two\nwidely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural\nordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in\ncapturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models\nexhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of\ndomain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation\ntools for reactive materials."}

Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best\nto the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.\nHowever, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and\nlikelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic\nerror correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model\nto map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model\nprediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of\nadjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic\nmetrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to\nthe observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological\nmean adjusted forecasts."}

Existing data-driven\nforecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short\ntime interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout\nfor long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers\nfrom two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and\nmulti-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)\nthe rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture\nof fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an\nAdaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather\nForecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a\nmulti-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time\nintervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures\nboth shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics\nacross different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes\nthe circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial\ninformation. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout\nscheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time\ninterval to forecast according to the current weather state.

In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare\ncategories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,\ndiversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or\nredundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse\nGeometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric\nregularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method\nintroduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation\nscore, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort\ninter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures\ntemporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By\ncombining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class\nseparation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or\nredundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R\nconsistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with\nfewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution data.

Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF\nmodels has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that\nreliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains\na challenge.

To\naddress this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:\ndata gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce\nAuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)\ninjects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters\noutputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for\npre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a\nfoundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a\ncompact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while\nSafiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;\ntrained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves\nrobust transfer across settings.

In this\nframework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational\ndivergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual\ninformation, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single\ngeometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not\nisolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory\nfurther predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise\nto an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)\nand over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors\nminimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,\nsuch as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and\ngeneralization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are\nused to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable\nredundancy level where generalization peaks.

Lifted training\nmethods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem\ninto a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the\nconstraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.\nThis chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted\ntraining strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel\nLifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse\narchitectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and\nProximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from\nconvex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates\ndistributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,\nand can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the\nimplementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,\nincluding deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive\noptimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.\nFurthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,\ndetailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,\nunrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.\nNumerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and\nstability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,\nparticularly for architectures employing proximal activations."}

However,\nexisting methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and\nscore-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These\ninclude an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear\nassociations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and\ninefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models\n(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by\na fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data\nis tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal\nanalysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex\nsystems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns\nfrom pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of\nevidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and\nrelational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and\nconditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data\n(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological\ndatasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures\nrobustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,\nachieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal\nfactors in Hepatitis C virus progression.

However, existing continuous-time methods face\nthree key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory\nwithout effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting\nin embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations\nbetween node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to\nfully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence\nof rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a\nnovel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory\nAugmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding\nstability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves\ncontextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.\nAdditionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes\nbetween nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new\nconnections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures\nstructural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction\nand node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across\nthree different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,\ngeneralizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the\nart in continuous-time dynamic graph learning.

To date, existing DFL methods\ntypically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient\nto capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address\nthis challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains\na diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and\noptimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn\nfrom the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate\ndiffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training\nthrough diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to\nthe need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we\npropose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward\ndiffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows\nfrom our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be\napproximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that\nour diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in\ndecision quality.

Using Huber\nregression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization\nin reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:\n(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment\nassumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded\nhypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional\ngeneralization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture\nout-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be\nquantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth\n$f^\\star$, which is $\\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of\nrobust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a\n\\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator\nwith high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition\nunder weak $(1+\\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new\ncomparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction\nerror up to a residual of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma^{-2\\epsilon})$, clarifying\nthe robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\\sigma$.\nBuilding on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence\nrates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and\nunder heavy-tailed noise.

Our theory\nprovides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives\nTransformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward\nstability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained\nTransformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization\naffects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training\ndynamics of each layer normalization placement.

Effective segmentation in these settings\nrequires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement\nthrough sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting\ndomain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series\nsegmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt\nquickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence.

A\nmemory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into\nmemory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new\nprediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts\naccumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the\nentire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and\nindustrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy\nimprovements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity\nsegmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement\nin iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage\npoints compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS.

For\nAuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,\nthereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday\nuser interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in\n31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion\nincreases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number\nProblems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs\nthemselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,\ntheir current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios."}

We introduce a new fine-tuning\nstrategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition\nability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher\nuses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then\nlabels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By\nmonitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile\nfor the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their\nresponses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two\nways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but\nadaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,\nthe teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across\nextensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements\nof up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,\nSTAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,\nAMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is\ncomplementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved\nusing STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We\nconclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current\ntraining pipelines. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/princeton-pli/STAT."}

In contrast,\nconvolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size\nlimits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,\nwe introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification\ncapability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of\nconvolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the\nnumber of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational\nresources.

While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a\nricher set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher\ngeneralization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this\ntrade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of\ncoloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence\nclasses induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity\n-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that\ngreater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization\nguarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable\nunder perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring\nrobustness to sampling variability across datasets.

Based on this insight, we propose\nan efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and\nhigh-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(h \\times d)$, where $h \\ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized\nthrough a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the\ntraining process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with\nsignificantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction\ngraphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with\nonly 1\\% of the parameter over LightGCN."}

Existing KV\ncache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires\nidentical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct\nprecomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and\nrepeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially\naddress these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This\npaper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and\nhigh generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit\nsimilar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model\nfor generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for\nrestoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response\nquality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:\n(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache\nrecomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection\naccuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)\ngrouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.\nExperiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention\nperformance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%\nand 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%).

In\nthis paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where\nsubtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream\nTC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF\nmodels has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that\nreliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains\na challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,\nnon-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks\ninfeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class\nimbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that\nwill produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining\nphysical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another\nsignificant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a\nnovel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate\nadversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model\nto approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of\ngradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function\nwith kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a\ndistance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to\nconstrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the\nadversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable."}

High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive\nmicrowave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of\nSM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary\nfactors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal\nresolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the\nlow-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale\nconvolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative\ncomponents: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing\ntemporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to\npreserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained\nseamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km\nspatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP\ndemonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet\nexhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,\noutperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet\nconsistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all\nsites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)\nIn the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using\nhigh-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as\nall methods maintained an average relative error within 6\\% for the R metric\nand 2\\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization\nvalidation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid\nspatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for\nspatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate\nspatio-temporal relationships in SM data."}

Our analysis reveals that while the recency\neffect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the\nprimacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is\nadditionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the\nformation of attention sinks.

A common remedy is to sparsify\nthe graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an\narbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information\nfrom other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view\ngraph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework\npartitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local\ninteractions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view\nrepresentations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing\narchitecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we\nformally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk\ncompared to single-graph message-passing models.

First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the\nsemantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,\nand label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic\nmulti-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity\ndistributions show statistically significant differences across models,\ndatasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing\nlabel-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific\nthresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5\nthresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work\nby an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance\neven with limited labeled examples."}

Recent work has introduced\nmulti-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a\nsingle model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,\nquantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency\nimproves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and\nactivates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present\nAnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded\nQuantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing\nweights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables\nbit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,\nbit-parallel arithmetic.

We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ\nstructure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible\noverhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly\nnarrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains\ncompetitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x\nover half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods.

Existing kernel-based approaches\noften test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified\nalternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel\nselection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the\nmanually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel\nselection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified\nfirst, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This\nchallenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select\na good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with\nthis challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,\ninstead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We\npropose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative\nsimilarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,\nQ) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two\nphases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer\nthe potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance\nof the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to\nderive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.\nLastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness\nvia extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

However, traditional PINNs often struggle\nwith challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of\nlabeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics\ninteractions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a\nGradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically\nintroduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving\nPDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems\nfrom various fields, each representing distinct scenarios.

Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We\nevaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while\nverbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to\nassess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and\nto select truly useful ones for unknown queries."}

While\nthey have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that\nrarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training\nhyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same\ndistribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in\nthe evaluation set is known.

Despite advances in\nuncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly\nunpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering\nthe full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs\nthe design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in\nrobustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens\nthis paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the\nlifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive\nre-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and\ncontroller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers\nto continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending\nthis approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each\ncycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT\nmodels, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and\ninform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The\nframework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled\nlearning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more\nstable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly\nenhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this\nwork include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation\nframework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed\ndesign, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making."}

Recently, generative networks have been\nincreasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the\noriginal datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative\nnetworks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain\nunclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and\nconstruction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a\ngiven tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given\nrooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an\nalphabet \\Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,\nordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \\Sigma with tree edit distance at most d\nfrom T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )\nand constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for\ngenerating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,\nthe networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree\nedit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN\nand GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced\nsignificantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%\nand 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards\nconstruction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and\nvalid tree-structured data generation.

However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily\nlarge model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory\nfootprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but\nnot all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep\narchitectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted\ncomputation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which\nin turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.\nTo address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which\nprovide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we\npropose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which\nbegins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally\nincreases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process\nuntil the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the\ngiven datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and\ninference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational\nefficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show\nthat the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve\nup to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a\ncompetitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively."}

This paper presents\nAEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration\nfor machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We\nintroduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a\nmetric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after\nmasking.

In this work, we\nreframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show\nthat performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each\nexcelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage\nthis finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and\nContext-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's\nprediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive\nper-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are\nnon-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective\nthat compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the\nGNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance\nacross node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up\nto $+13\\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance.

Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a\nhigh-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL\ndataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the\nagentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including\nAIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,\n4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance\ncompared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:\nhttps://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL"}

Most existing works adopt a simplified approach\n- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for\nheterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph\nheterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response\nvaries across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic\ncorrelation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed\nfilter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve\nexpressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a\nheterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily\ndegree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters\nto fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals\nthat the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not\nfollow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to\nguarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a\nsimple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily\nspectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD\nNAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over\nleading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs."}

To address this\nissue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis\nstrategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create\ndata tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.\nSpecifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a\nquery-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher\nresponse quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned\nprompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate\nthen Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for\nthe entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset.

This reveals that these traditional quantities are not\nisolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory\nfurther predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise\nto an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)\nand over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors\nminimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,\nsuch as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and\ngeneralization near this equilibrium.

We predict cognitive performance from social determinants\nof health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset\nderived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012\nMexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).\n  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven\ndomains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and\nexecutive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves.

While entropy regularization is\na common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed\ncoefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we\nrevisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been\nlargely underestimated.

To reduce runtime computation, Online\nTop-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a\nsubset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By\ncombining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#\nachieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss.

To address this, we propose a\nframework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its\n\\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm\n(AIGN) over training.

DIKD establishes a\nconnection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich\nRGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by\nfeeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop\nsupervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are\nsemantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge\ntransfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on\npublic thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while\ndrastically reducing computational overhead."}

A primary\ncause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on\nfeatures that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We\nintroduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that\nidentifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test\ndistributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features\nwhile varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations\nusing Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance\ndirections associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by\nremoving their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed\nrepresentations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously\ntracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal\nfeatures. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and\nempirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks.

However, we observe a phenomenon that\ndirectly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly\nsimilar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the\neffectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated\nstatistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance\nbetween different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a\ntrade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual\nkernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This\nmotivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages\ninformation from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual\nperformance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous\ntheoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and\ncontrol of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed\nstatistics.

Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and\nsupervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward\nfundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical\ndecision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal\nthat RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining\nstable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic\nattractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,\nwhich converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We\nfurther show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a\npowerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that\nenhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous\nsolutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex\ndynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and\ncorrelates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity\nincreases.

Despite their\nnow established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to\nflagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than\nprecisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection\ngranularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,\nensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,\nevaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent\nwork made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus\nnarrowing down the vulnerability detection \"window\" and providing more\nfine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the\npresence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often\npredominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we\ninvestigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an\nexplainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection\nAlignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines\nthat most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the\nvulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and\nadaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze\nmultiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we\nshow how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by\nnon-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and\nspurious correlations.

At inference,\nwe decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,\nkeeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.\nAcross three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the\nbenefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference\ndecoupling."}

In this paper, we propose a learned compression\nframework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model\nweights.

At inference,\nwe decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,\nkeeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.\nAcross three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the\nbenefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference\ndecoupling."}

Under review at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,\nmulti-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,\niterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while\nfast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded\nperformance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this\ngap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,\nlies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including\ndiffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of\nlearning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer\ndesign space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative\nTrajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns\nthe entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical\nfor offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled\nadaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative\npolicies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks."}

In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to\naccurately \"throw-flip\" objects to a desired landing pose (position and\norientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from\nparasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing\nposes. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile\ndynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to\nunseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods.

To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel\nend-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D\nrepresentations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of\nboth modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features\nfrom 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based\ngait features.

During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually\nreconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where\nthe loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,\nand 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial\nalignment and consistent 3D structure.

However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm\nrather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the\ntransfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address\nthis challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity\nand provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,\nexisting methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label\ninformation and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical\ntransferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning\nScore (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization\nperformance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by\nestablishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision\nboundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is\nefficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive\ndistribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a\ngeneral framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or\nnegative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error,\nenabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to\nencoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer\npipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or\ndegrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in\ntransfer learning."}

This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection.

While deep learning models have advanced in network\narchitecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated\ndata. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal\ntasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random\nmixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the\nlack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose\nMS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that\nautomatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key\ncomponents of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)\nstrategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples\nwith contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module\nusing multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios\ndynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment\nAlignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across\nmodalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional\nregularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone\nnetwork jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six\nstate-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms\nexisting methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment\naugmentation.

We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and\ngeneral decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of\nstabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our\narchitecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of\nstabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations\nto build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves\nsubstantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a\ndedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across\nvarious code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural\nnetwork-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with\nordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline.

However, the necessity of each of\nthese principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically\ndeconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax\nthese principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid\narchitectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical\nanalysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their\nabsence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical\nform and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when\npreserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in\nisolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard\nattention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our\nunderstanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new\navenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance."}

However, multi-modal methods face\nsignificant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can\nbe oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel\nneighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors\n(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables\nNV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target\nentities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector\nextraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector\ndensity-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination\nof up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied\nelement-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and\nvalue and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention\nmechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated\nsuperior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial\nshapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%\nmean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%\nand 4.23% mAP, respectively.

In this\nwork, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders\n(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term\nRepresentation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality\nreconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a\nscalable transformer-based architecture.

In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process.
