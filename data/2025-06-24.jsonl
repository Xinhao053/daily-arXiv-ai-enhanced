To accomplish\nthis, we formulate and rigorously evaluate several statistical models,\nincluding neural network, random forest, and linear regression. These models\nuse the observed characteristics of the options as inputs -- their price,\nmoneyness and time-to-maturity, as well as a small set of external inputs, such\nas the SPX and its past history, dividend yield, and the risk-free rate. Model\nevaluation is performed on historical options data, spanning 30 years of daily\nobservations. Significant effort is given to understanding the data and\nensuring explainability for the neural network. A neural network model with two\nhidden layers and four neurons per layer, trained with minimal hyperparameter\ntuning, performs well against the theoretical Black-Scholes-Merton model for\nEuropean options, as well as two other empirical models based on the random\nforest and the linear regression. It delivers arbitrage-free option prices\nwithout requiring these conditions to be imposed."}

Building on prior work, we\nderive and solve Volterra integral equations of the second kind to determine\nthe exercise boundary explicitly, offering a computationally superior\nalternative to traditional finite-difference and Monte Carlo methods. We\naddress key open problems: (1) extending the decomposition method, i.e.\nsplitting the American option price into its European counterpart and an early\nexercise premium, to general jump-diffusion and Levy models; (2) handling cases\nwhere closed-form transition densities are unavailable by leveraging\ncharacteristic functions via, e.g., the COS method; and (3) generalizing the\nframework to multidimensional diffusions.

The constraints on the Tsallis entropy\nare in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to\n$p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not\nnormalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE);\nhowever, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide\nevidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\\kappa$, where\n$d$ is the dimension and $\\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary\nrobustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for\nthe coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential\nfamily, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables\n$(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems,\n$q=1+\\frac{\\alpha\\kappa}{1+d\\kappa}$, where $\\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter\ngoverning the shape of distributions near their location and $\\kappa$ is the\nparameter determining the asymptotic tail decay.

The inferior and\ninferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,\ncontributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive\nexpansion with increasing disease severity.\n  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF\nloss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical\nregion contributing to model predictions."}

To\nmitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to\nreduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear\nwhether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.\nTherefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which\naims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the\ngoal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework\nthat learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise\ncan trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level\nperturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic\nembedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To\nimprove stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes\nthe difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring\nthe attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can\neffectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned\nnoise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples\ncan reveal forgotten content in unseen images.

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer.

Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of\nsafety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those\nresponsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response\ngeneration. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the\nrecently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety\nmechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling\nthese experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful\nrequests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that\ndisabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal\nrate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set\nof experts on overall model safety."}

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we\nespecially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be\nunderstood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear\napproximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the\nparametric space."}

Our method not only overcomes the ten\nidentified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than\ntraditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our\nlearning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our\nprobabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable\nobjective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the\ncorrespondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with\nrespect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical\neffectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by\nachieving state-of-the-art performance.

In contrast,\nSimplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,\nmaintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear\ntransformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing\nover-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the\nmodel's expressive capacity.\n  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a\nnovel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving\ntheir expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)\nlayer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)\nlow-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and\n(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and\naccelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly\nimproving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,\nLGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and\nContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers\na general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The\ncode is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN]."}

We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online\nsetting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query\nrefinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets\nor model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:\nthe prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a\nblack-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address\nthis, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM\nselection under unstructured prompt dynamics.

The success of the No-U-Turn\nSampler (NUTS) largely stems from its clever local adaptation of the\nintegration time in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via a geometric U-turn condition.\nHowever, posterior distributions frequently exhibit multi-scale geometries with\nextreme variations in scale, making it necessary to also adapt the leapfrog\nintegrator's step size locally and dynamically. Despite its practical\nimportance, this problem has remained largely open since the introduction of\nNUTS by Hoffman and Gelman (2014). To address this issue, we introduce the\nWithin-orbit Adaptive Leapfrog No-U-Turn Sampler (WALNUTS), a generalization of\nNUTS that adapts the leapfrog step size at fixed intervals of simulated time as\nthe orbit evolves. At each interval, the algorithm selects the largest step\nsize from a dyadic schedule that keeps the energy error below a user-specified\nthreshold. Like NUTS, WALNUTS employs biased progressive state selection to\nfavor states with positions that are further from the initial point along the\norbit.

In this work, we evaluate the\nvulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective\nmodel acquisition in non-adversarial research settings.

By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,\nthese models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass\ntask-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the\ndomain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while\nmillions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the\ninternet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of\nthousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as\noverfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications\ntypically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due\nto limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or\ntext-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary\ndrastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask\ntraining. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for\nphysics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.\nIt uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales\ninto a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token\nprediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate\nthe rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a\nspecialized refinement module.

Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,\nprompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim\nrepresentation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review\nexamines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and\npractitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review\nmethodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024\ninvestigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary\nprompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,\nself-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and\nparameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential\nfor reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias\ntypes. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to\nprompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines\ndemonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction\nin bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting\noffers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness.

However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual\nor extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex\noperational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a\nnovel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models\ndirectly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming\nreasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows\nfor the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,\nconfidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals\nwithin its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,\nimplemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into\nlogical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine\nadaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal\nreasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces\nenables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing\norganizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and\nextraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of\nPyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.\nThis integration finds utility across numerous domains, including\nmanufacturing, healthcare, and business operations."}

In these complex domains, exact\nposterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,\nmotivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).\nHowever, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from\nslow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via\nNatural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to\nefficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational\nposterior.

Reasoning with table-structured data poses\nsignificant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden\nsemantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges\nis lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances\nof LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,\npresenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which\nmeasures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning\nabilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through\nan iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to\nrobustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference\nmodes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT.

Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.\nOverall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL\ngrounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity."}

To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly\npost-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device\nquantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates\nthe integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into\nhigher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a\ndecomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by\nadaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In\ndeployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between\nthe full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to\nresource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the\nImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve\nhigh performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,\nstorage consumption, and switching overheads.

However, existing frameworks\noften lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,\ninterpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a\nfederated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with\na novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable\nuncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment\ntechnique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input\nfeatures influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and\npixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods\nsuch as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+\noffers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach\nthrough experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high\nprediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with\ntransparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable\nuncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance\ncan be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+\ndelivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational\noverhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.\nOverall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally\nefficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized\npredictive modeling."}

Paper length: 20 pages of main text + 2 pages of references\n  + 21 pages of appendices", "summary": "People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a\nrandom event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we\nespecially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be\nunderstood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear\napproximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the\nparametric space."}

While prior work has improved the timeliness and\naccuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into\nactionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the\ndecoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can\nsignificantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency\nresponse, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not\njust incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive\nSpatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting\nparadigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework\nensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby\nmaximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new\nResource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively\ncaptures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,\nproducing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate\nactionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent\n(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms\npredictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving\noptimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.\nExperimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction\naccuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics."}

This has inspired many recent works on mitigating\nmiscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to\nobtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification\nperformance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize\nprevious works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,\nbinning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.\nThrough theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations\nin previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a\nprobabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which\ntheoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical\ncalibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective\npost-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten\nidentified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than\ntraditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our\nlearning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our\nprobabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable\nobjective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the\ncorrespondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with\nrespect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical\neffectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by\nachieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference\nfor learning reliable likelihood in related fields."}

Existing GNN explanations\ntypically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible\nfor the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack\nfiner-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations\ncontribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model\ndiagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel\nGNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in\na progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and\na target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks (\"model\nslice\") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block\nthat clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although\nfinding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop\nefficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate\nand maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.\nAdditionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing\ndeclarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.\nThrough experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN\narchitectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and\nillustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging."}

This ubiquity has led to a\nrise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal\nData Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,\ncharacterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity\nand temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data\nanalysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of\nmissing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the\ngenerative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to\naddress the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical\nassumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as\nother data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that\nimpact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in\nGANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been\napplied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental\nassumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation\nof main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of\nmethods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.\nOur findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve\nusability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need\nfor more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges\npresented by longitudinal data with missing values.

Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where\nmisbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning\nattacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.\nWhile prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat\nmodels, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact\ngeneralization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat\nmodels, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact\nof suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical\ninvestigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are\nintrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,\nwe prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a\nrobust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,\ndegrades by an additive factor of $\\varTheta ( \\frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the\nnumber of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine\nattacks, the degradation is in $\\mathcal{O} \\big( \\sqrt{ \\frac{f}{n-2f}}\n\\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is\nespecially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\\frac{n}{2}$."}

We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval\nwithout graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet\neffective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact\nentity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it\nidentifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and\nassembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or\nedge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index\nToken Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved\ncontent. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG\noutperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing\nindex size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of\nstructure-free, entity-centric context selection.

Traditional MOT\nmethods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data\nassociation and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully\ndata-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer\ndistinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods\nare generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven\nMOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for\ntraining is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can\nintegrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that\nutilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model\nin Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,\nthe performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.\nTo ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid\nhigh-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to\nperform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines\nthe flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to\nlearn complex information from data of neural networks.

However,\nefficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of\nExperts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter\nor degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel\napproach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection\nexperts.

These methods\ndepart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as\nApriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating\nprior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic\ninference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to\nmodel item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled\ninference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen\nitemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and\noptional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification\nthrough full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,\nincluding its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the\nitemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a\ngeneralizable policy for identifying high-quality rules.

As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt\npre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.\nHowever, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT\nmethods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach\nspecifically designed for Mamba.

RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve\noptimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is\nknown to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,\nwhile remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,\nthe transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and\nnon-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for\nWhittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current\ntransition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper\nconfidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data\nover a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the\npredicted transition kernels.

Under review", "summary": "Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a\nway to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal\nnew data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred\nfeatures are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty\nof quantifying whether two tasks are \"related\". To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during\npretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and\nperform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training\nmixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this\nphenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data\ndistribution or ordering affect the features that current representation\nlearning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely\non large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific\ntraining, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a\npotential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,\npresent existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards\naddressing this challenge."}

When employing\nthe penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of\npenalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,\nincreasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.\nTo address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)\nalgorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO\nproblem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with\nrandomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited\nprecision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an\nupper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental\nresults using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on\nthe Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision."}

This primary\nlimitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which\nresults in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the\nchallenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of\ngenerating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of\nthe reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct\nanswer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free\nframework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains.

We find that addressing the\nhigh variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and\npropose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable\nreward from LLM intrinsic probabilities.

In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we\nconclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks\nand improve the calibration of reasoning models."}

While deep learning has\ndemonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,\nachieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable\nremains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured\nKolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates\nstructured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).\nSKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function\napproximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual\nsensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable\nquantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent\nrepresentation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of\nKAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing\ndynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the\nNeural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to\nrefine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered\nequations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive\nexperiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE\nachieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent\nmodels that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems."}

Furthermore, we introduce a\nmulti-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level\nrepresentations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and\nMELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in\nenhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in\nemotion recognition.

When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in\nreal-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous\ntemporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful\napplications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus\non preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order\ngroup interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world\nnetworks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static\nhomogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in\nHTGs.

The\ndiscrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions\ndegrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied\nto others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has\nbeen introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing\nmulti-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the\nextent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely\nstudied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact\non fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the\nmodel to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall\ngeneralization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing\nend-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically\nin variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a\nreal-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,\naiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant\noperating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with\na retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant\nfault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the\nsource domain.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.
