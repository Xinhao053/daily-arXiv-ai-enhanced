Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals.

DeliberationJudge is more efficient and\nmore aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With\nDeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in\ndeliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority\npositions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate\ndeliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative\nand equitable for policymaking."}

Accordingly, recent\nefforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if\nretrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a\nlong input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents\nfindings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic\nexperiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,\nand coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all\nrelevant information, their performance still degrades substantially\n(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'\nclaimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are\nreplaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when\nthey are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant\ntokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is\nplaced immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a\npreviously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt\nLLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.\nThey motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a\nlong-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the\nretrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem.

H1B-KV\nrepresents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling\nhardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using\n4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter\nLLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x\nreduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches\nfull-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on\ncomplex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task\nunderstanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV\nsignificantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction\n(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,\nestablishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained\nenvironments."}

We also use the derived layer-wise\nbounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,\nadjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we\nintroduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification\naccuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that\nby reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in\nsome tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold\nstart\" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled\nnodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size\n(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.\nThis is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of\ntrainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of\nthe GNN."}

This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues.

Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong\nITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when\nguided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early\nin the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:\nit myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially\ncorrect hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,\nEntropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by\nmonitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by\ndynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these\nmethods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse\nsolution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately\nleading to higher-quality solutions."}

The former allows us to remove coalitions with\nvanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The\nlatter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of\nhierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply\na unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical\nproperties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the\nprojection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion\nalgebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain\npreviously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new\nperspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph\nstructured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up\nthe possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine\nlearning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many\nmore."}

A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical\ncase, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability\ndistributions $p_1, \\dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \\{1, 2, \\dots, d\\}$, and one wishes\nto accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a\nknown hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c =\n2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \\gg \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2} +\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from\n$d_{\\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\\mathrm{avg}},q) > \\epsilon$. This nearly matches the\noptimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \\gg\n\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and\ngeneralizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we\nstudy the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum\nstates. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional\nhypothesis state $\\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state\n$\\rho_1, \\dots, \\rho_T$, one can distinguish $\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\sigma$\nfrom $D_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}},\\sigma) > \\epsilon$ provided $T \\gg\nd/\\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent\ndistance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is\nsurprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the\nclassical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the\nnon-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool\nwe introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and\nmore generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting."}

These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models.
