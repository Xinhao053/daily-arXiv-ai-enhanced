In applications with\nmultiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn\nspurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for\natypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by\noptimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically\nassume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately\nestimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in\nnoisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust\noptimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each\ngroup, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the\nworst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to\nsolve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data."}

In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that\nthis subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers\nacross different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on\ndifferent CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other\nmethods, which may be of independent interest."}

Our key\nfindings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias\ntowards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and\nSocial content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix.

Most existing\nunsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable\ncross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these\nmethods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node\ndistinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the\nmisalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature\nheterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node\ncorrespondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that\nsimultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency\nacross latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines\nlow-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both\nstructure-aware and highly discriminative.

Evaluating Benign Traffic in Intrusion Detection Datasets", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.LG"], "comment": "10 pages; accepted to SBP-BRiMS 2025 Poster Session", "summary": "Supervised machine learning techniques rely on labeled data to achieve high\ntask performance, but this requires the labels to capture some meaningful\ndifferences in the underlying data structure. For training network intrusion\ndetection algorithms, most datasets contain a series of attack classes and a\nsingle large benign class which captures all non-attack network traffic. A\nreview of intrusion detection papers and guides that explicitly state their\ndata preprocessing steps identified that the majority took the labeled\ncategories of the dataset at face value when training their algorithms. The\npresent paper evaluates the structure of benign traffic in several common\nintrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS 2017) and\ndetermines whether there are meaningful sub-categories within this traffic\nwhich may improve overall multi-classification performance using common machine\nlearning techniques. We present an overview of some unsupervised clustering\ntechniques (e.g., HDBSCAN, Mean Shift Clustering) and show how they\ndifferentially cluster the benign traffic space."}

SAMI offers one\nsolution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is\nconstrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an\neffective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to\nintuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.\nTo explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs\nzero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum\nintroduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its\nperformance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this\ntask. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking\nsystem, enabling personality-informed social recommendations.

This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\"\napproach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and\nsubgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have\nlimitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and\nembodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an\nembodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we\npresent a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits\nseveral desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without\nstrictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction\nproblem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high\ninvariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across\nboth training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric\nmap representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to\nobtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a\nlocal controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level\n\"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB\ninput. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over\nits image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple\nnavigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding\ncapability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We\nfurther show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world\nindoor environments.

Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can\ndramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural\nquestion: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action\nplanning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models.

To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven\nExploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense\nof curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from\nboth the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its\ngenerated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates\nfrom a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus\nwithin the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and\npromotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the\ncritic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.\nEmpirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over\nstandard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a\ncalibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM\nfailure modes."}
