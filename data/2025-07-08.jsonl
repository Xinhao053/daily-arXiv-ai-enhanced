In this paper, we make the first attempt to\nmitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive\nConfounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world\nknowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden\nconfounders.

To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning\nstrategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders\nand significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets\nand LLMs."}

The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is\nsimplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an\naccuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has\nbecome clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models\ndo not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help\nexplain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to\nconsider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the\nRashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam\nDilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern\ncomputers, with which my observations are much easier to make.\n  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:\nsimpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with\nthe outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the\nuse of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is\nuseful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.\n  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two\nCultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,\naccuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,\nwithout the limitations Breiman was concerned about."}

A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote\nexploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent\napproach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),\nthe method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic\nassumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep\nReinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM\ndifferences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal\ncaptures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured\nby reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms\nexisting curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster\nconvergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with\ncomparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves\nthe highest average performance in the Infeasible variant.

Recent work has\nshown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time\ndiscrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to\nautoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first\nintroduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and\nlearned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those\nestablished for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved\nupper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching\nperformed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and\ncorrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with\nup to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training\nsteps.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin.

Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than\nshape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract\nshapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a\nsolution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than\nscaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early\ninfancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising\ndecades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel\ndevelopmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision.

To address this, stochastic emulators\nhave emerged as efficient surrogate models capable of capturing the random\nresponse of simulators at reduced cost.

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship\nbetween prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate\nuncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast\nto conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a\ndistribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with\n20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter\nquery-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based\nchain-of-thought methods.

In most scenarios of interest, the\ndynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the\nenvironment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on\nobject-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more\neffectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional\ngeneralization. However, the development of object-centric world models has\nlargely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as\nbasic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize\nto more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this\npaper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world\nmodel built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in\nobject-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations\nand modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our\nmethod can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,\noutperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by\ndecoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware\ncomponents, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate\nmore diverse imagined trajectories."}

This\ndiversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to\ncompare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical\nsolution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of\nreference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many\ncommonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of\ncomprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap\nby providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the\ntype of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively\nstudied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By\ngrouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,\nthis survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select\nappropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves\nindividual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across\ndifferent models and applications."}

Traditional methods face the\nfollowing two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific\ndata: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in\nscientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.\nSecondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space\nexpands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.\nAdvancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have\nopened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by\nthat, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and\nproposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in\nthe iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical\ntransformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature\ncombinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement\nlearning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration\nphase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively\nevaluate the generated features of each significant model performance\nbreakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate\nthat the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process\nand significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks."}

Here, we introduce the\nPEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal\ndifferential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from\nchaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This\napproach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization\nlandscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process\nwithout distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by\nrecovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from\nnoise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of\nthe dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is\ncorrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that\nthis method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct\nsymbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount\nof data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method\nderives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as\nnetwork sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing\nyet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving\nmicroscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent\nrelationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and\nsynchrony in neural circuits.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their\nextension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,\nthe challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled\nphysical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical\nDeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked\nusing both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our\nresults demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is\ncrucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch\ncounterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer\nadvantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these\nsurrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than\nhigh-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy."}

We show that fine tuning\non insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we\nidentify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs\nalignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and\nby misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can\ndegrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.\nOur findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed\nmisalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The\nresults underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that\npreserve intended behavior across domains."}

One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals\nand several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work\nvalidating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its\nadoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated\nmachine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as\ninput features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy\n(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant\ncorrelation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional\nhuman-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a\nstructured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,\nreliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the\nconstraints that previously limited adoption."}

However, interpretable models often struggle to\nachieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for\nhigh-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable\nregression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic\ncodes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are\ninfrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge\ncan address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we\ndemonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective\nregularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all\ndiagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters\n(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the\ndimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model\ninterpretability and consistency.

Unlike prior methods that use\nshallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,\nmodality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are\ninjected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and\nbetter capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we\nincorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to\naggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a\ncross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image\nand text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle\nsarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's\nsuperior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.\nFurther cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across\ndomains, consistently outperforming baseline methods."}

We train diagnostic\nstress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between\nstressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high\naccuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress.

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This\nhinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,\ninspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness\non OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups\naccording to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and\nused for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as\nOOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.\nCode is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc."}

We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results\nreveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,\nunderscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms\nfor LLM agents."}

The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise\noverview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse\nstochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.\n  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive\nLangevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions\ngiven noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms\npresented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient\nalgorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic\ngradient algorithm is in operation."}

This paper introduces ESSA\n(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for\ngradient computation.

This\nstudy investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization\nframework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five\nuse cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code\ngeneration, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how\nprompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases\ndemonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use\ncase and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed\nnotable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a\nsubstantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the\nrouter agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and\nof a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was\nexplored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,\nusing the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.\nOverall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt\noptimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning\nand example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by\ntask, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt\noptimization research."}

Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four\nleading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)\nshow that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while\nmaintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval.

In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm.

This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks."}

In this work, we empirically analyze how neural\nnetworks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural\ntangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance\nscaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard\nvision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even\nthough the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates\nthat performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying\nmechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in\nneural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling\nbehavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature\nlearning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition\nbetween kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes.

Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common\nlinguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural\nlanguage plus \"grassroots mathematics\".\n  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and\ncardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and\ndrowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a\nsmall fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning\nabout comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide\nnormal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical\nnotions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we\ndiscuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,\nand what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.\n  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form\nmethods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to\nadditive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple\ncounting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We\nalso define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility\nrelations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such\nas the Pigeonhole Principle.\n  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the\narchitecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and\nsyntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of\nlogic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the\nqualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical\nfindings in cognitive science."}

This dilemma of conflicting\nrankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion\nto a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking\ndisagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,\ndifferent models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test\ntask. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model\nthe same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary\ncontribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24\nbenchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves\nranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have\nlittle external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of\nexternal validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer\ngracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,\ntrain-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect\nagreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to\nessentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of\nbenchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make\ntrain-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking."}

However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions.

However, this independence consideration increases\nthe likelihood that classification errors in one tree are repeated in others,\npotentially leading to significant bias in causal e ect estimation. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach that establishes connections between causal\ntrees through the Limit Inferior Leaf Interval (LILI) clustering algorithm.\nLILIs are constructed based on the leaves of all causal trees, emphasizing the\nsimilarity of dataset confounders. When two instances with di erent treatments\nare grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they\nare treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering\nmechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree\nmethods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect\n(ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal\ninference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by\nrelating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set\ntheory.

Bayesian\ninverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of\nToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these\npredictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and\nactions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in\nsolving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning\ntasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By\ncombining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each\ncomponent, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse\nplanning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs\nalone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically\nperform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict\nmental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future\ndevelopment of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative\nagents."}

In this study, we address\nthis question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven\napproach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how\nour model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical\nhistory, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.\nIn fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)\npredicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune.

Another\nchallenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy\narrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the\nUAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nsolution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices\nto be attested during each flight.

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns.

Slimming lets the model\noperate at different utilization factors (UF), each corresponding to a\ndifferent performance/efficiency trade-off, effectively mimicking multiple\nmodel sizes without the extra storage costs. In addition, a router subnet,\ntrained end-to-end with the backbone, determines the optimal UF for the current\ninput. Thus, the system saves resources by adaptively selecting smaller UFs\nwhen additional complexity is unnecessary.

POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using\nReinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly\nenhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%\nto 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,\nscaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation\nand performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.\nThe impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties\nsuggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong\nreward models."}

Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms\nto leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances\nvision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting\napproach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement\nlearning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve\nvision-language model responses by establishing preferences for\nnavigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided\nVision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and\nvision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve\nperformance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering\ntasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving\ngeneralization to diverse driving scenarios.

To address this,\nwe have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source\nseparation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly\ntrains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical\nsignal of interest and the other for learning the effective background\ncontribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a\nreconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or\npre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by\nconsidering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as\nexperimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a\nfour-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background\ncontributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found\nto successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or\nstructured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four\ndimensions of the parameter space.

In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term\nimage-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer\nrange temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA\ncomprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns\nand fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a\nmore unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature\nPropagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image\nfeatures, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;\nand 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency\nacross driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA\nmaintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational\noverhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream\nLiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves\nboth LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work\ninspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code\nhas be made publicly accessible for future research."}
