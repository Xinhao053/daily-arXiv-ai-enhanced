In this paper, we make the first attempt to\nmitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive\nConfounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world\nknowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden\nconfounders.

To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning\nstrategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders\nand significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets\nand LLMs."}

The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is\nsimplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an\naccuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has\nbecome clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models\ndo not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help\nexplain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to\nconsider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the\nRashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam\nDilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern\ncomputers, with which my observations are much easier to make.\n  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:\nsimpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with\nthe outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the\nuse of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is\nuseful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.\n  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two\nCultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,\naccuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,\nwithout the limitations Breiman was concerned about."}

A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote\nexploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent\napproach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),\nthe method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic\nassumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep\nReinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM\ndifferences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal\ncaptures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured\nby reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms\nexisting curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster\nconvergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with\ncomparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves\nthe highest average performance in the Infeasible variant.

Recent work has\nshown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time\ndiscrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to\nautoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first\nintroduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and\nlearned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those\nestablished for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved\nupper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching\nperformed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and\ncorrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with\nup to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training\nsteps.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin.

Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than\nshape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract\nshapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a\nsolution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than\nscaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early\ninfancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising\ndecades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel\ndevelopmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems\nthrough this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with\nhuman behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the\nstrongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape\nrecognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image\ncorruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks.

To address this, stochastic emulators\nhave emerged as efficient surrogate models capable of capturing the random\nresponse of simulators at reduced cost.

This work introduces\nan active learning framework to further reduce the computational burden of\nreliability analysis using stochastic emulators.

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship\nbetween prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate\nuncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast\nto conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a\ndistribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with\n20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter\nquery-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based\nchain-of-thought methods.

In most scenarios of interest, the\ndynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the\nenvironment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on\nobject-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more\neffectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional\ngeneralization. However, the development of object-centric world models has\nlargely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as\nbasic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize\nto more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this\npaper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world\nmodel built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in\nobject-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations\nand modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our\nmethod can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,\noutperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by\ndecoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware\ncomponents, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate\nmore diverse imagined trajectories."}

This\ndiversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to\ncompare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical\nsolution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of\nreference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many\ncommonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of\ncomprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap\nby providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the\ntype of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively\nstudied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By\ngrouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,\nthis survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select\nappropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves\nindividual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across\ndifferent models and applications."}

Traditional methods face the\nfollowing two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific\ndata: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in\nscientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.\nSecondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space\nexpands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.\nAdvancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have\nopened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by\nthat, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and\nproposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in\nthe iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical\ntransformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature\ncombinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement\nlearning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration\nphase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively\nevaluate the generated features of each significant model performance\nbreakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate\nthat the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process\nand significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks."}

Here, we introduce the\nPEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal\ndifferential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from\nchaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This\napproach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization\nlandscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process\nwithout distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by\nrecovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from\nnoise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of\nthe dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is\ncorrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that\nthis method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct\nsymbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount\nof data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method\nderives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as\nnetwork sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing\nyet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving\nmicroscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent\nrelationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and\nsynchrony in neural circuits.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their\nextension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,\nthe challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled\nphysical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical\nDeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked\nusing both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our\nresults demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is\ncrucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch\ncounterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer\nadvantages for decoupled or single-physics problems.

We show that fine tuning\non insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we\nidentify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs\nalignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and\nby misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can\ndegrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.\nOur findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed\nmisalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The\nresults underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that\npreserve intended behavior across domains."}

However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals\nand several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work\nvalidating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its\nadoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated\nmachine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as\ninput features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy\n(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant\ncorrelation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional\nhuman-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a\nstructured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,\nreliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the\nconstraints that previously limited adoption."}

However, interpretable models often struggle to\nachieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for\nhigh-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable\nregression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic\ncodes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are\ninfrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge\ncan address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we\ndemonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective\nregularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all\ndiagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters\n(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the\ndimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model\ninterpretability and consistency.

Unlike prior methods that use\nshallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,\nmodality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are\ninjected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and\nbetter capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we\nincorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to\naggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a\ncross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image\nand text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle\nsarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's\nsuperior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.\nFurther cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across\ndomains, consistently outperforming baseline methods."}

We train diagnostic\nstress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between\nstressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high\naccuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress.

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This\nhinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,\ninspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness\non OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups\naccording to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and\nused for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as\nOOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.\nCode is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc."}

To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,\nmultimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically\nrenders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through\ntemporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then\nassessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a\nfine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.\nWe construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30\nleading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking\nconsistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web\ndevelopment, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts.

The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial\nintelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more\nchallenging.

We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results\nreveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,\nunderscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms\nfor LLM agents."}

This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector.

This paper introduces ESSA\n(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for\ngradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable\nproperties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to\nsparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially\nwhen starting from a strong pre-trained policy.

This\nstudy presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image)\ndataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science\ncompetition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived\nsuch that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for\nothers writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The\nArt LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical\nprogramming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current\nLLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian),\nproviding insights into their applicability in CS education and competition\nsettings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding\neducational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM\nusage.

This HTR model\nprovides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline\nis fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal\npost-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The\ncorrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a\nprompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction\n(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for\nambiguous readings (Stage 4).

An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of\nplasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts\noptimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it\nresults in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In\nthis paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that\nprevents unbounded weight growth without losing information.

Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four\nleading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)\nshow that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while\nmaintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval.

Existing methods address\nstructural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start\ninference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,\nthis results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further\nchallenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention\nmask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a \"student\"\nprediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and\na \"teacher\" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks."}

In this work, we empirically analyze how neural\nnetworks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural\ntangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance\nscaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard\nvision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even\nthough the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates\nthat performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying\nmechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in\nneural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling\nbehavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature\nlearning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition\nbetween kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the\nmaximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we\nfind to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model\nwidths."}

Evaluating Generalist Text Embeddings for Zero-Shot Recommendation and Search", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "comment": "Accept as Short Paper at RecSys 2025", "summary": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic\nrepresentations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential\nrecommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata,\nwhile in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent.\nRecent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to\nimprove representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing\nthat Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale\ncorpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized\nadaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and\nfine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We\nattribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute\nfeatures more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that\ncompressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions\n(e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of\nspecialized models.

This dilemma of conflicting\nrankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion\nto a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking\ndisagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,\ndifferent models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test\ntask. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model\nthe same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary\ncontribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24\nbenchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves\nranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have\nlittle external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of\nexternal validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer\ngracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,\ntrain-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect\nagreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to\nessentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of\nbenchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make\ntrain-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking."}

This omission can lead to information degradation and\nreduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological\noutcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,\ncharacterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.\nThis model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and\nchannel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual\nreinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint\nlearning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and\nspatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation\nforgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a\ntokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of\nfine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance\nspatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture\ninter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in\nEEG analysis.

In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of\nLLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset.

We also assess the security of patches generated by\nthree top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb)\non a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and\nproject-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents\nare most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the\nstandalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers,\nwith many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code.\nAgentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities,\nparticularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the\nlikelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements.

These results suggest that contextual factors play a\ncritical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need\nfor proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and\nissue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools."}

To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP).

In this study, we address\nthis question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven\napproach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how\nour model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical\nhistory, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.\nIn fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)\npredicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then\nshow how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is\nthe root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way\naround. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying\ndynamical property, most likely their formation location.

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job\nfailures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not\nan explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice.

Our model has\nshown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions,\ntexture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges.\nCLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic\ncontext that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL\nmodule plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through\niterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018\nand EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This\nsuperior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive\nlearning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning."}

Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:\n(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has\nachieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a\nnovel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture\ncritical geometric relationships among anatomical structures.

To address this,\nwe have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source\nseparation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly\ntrains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical\nsignal of interest and the other for learning the effective background\ncontribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a\nreconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or\npre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by\nconsidering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as\nexperimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a\nfour-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background\ncontributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found\nto successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or\nstructured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four\ndimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the\nchoice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a\nversatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse\ndomains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to\nstructural features in biomedical image reconstructions."}

In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the\ninteractions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent\npredictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in\ntheir problem formulation but also in the model architectures and\nimplementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,\nwe systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,\nincluding post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the\nmodel for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We\nevaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and\ninference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and\nlimitations of each approach.

Specifically, it is challenging to\naddress prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent\nequipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)\nrecent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,\nsuch a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating\nin the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to\ncollect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected \"Reasoning about\nEnvironments and Actions\" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed\nstruggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a\n\"spatio-temporal LLM\" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve\nboth spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of\nrecent observations.

However, existing LiDAR representation strategies\noften overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term\nimage-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer\nrange temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA\ncomprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns\nand fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a\nmore unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature\nPropagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image\nfeatures, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;\nand 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency\nacross driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA\nmaintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational\noverhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream\nLiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves\nboth LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work\ninspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code\nhas be made publicly accessible for future research."}
