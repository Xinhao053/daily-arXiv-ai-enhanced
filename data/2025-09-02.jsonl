An option strategy for a\nknown set of options is a specified set of rules which detail how these options\nare to be traded (i.e.~bought, rolled over, sold) depending upon market\nconditions.\n  We consider option strategies in the context of enhanced indexation, but we\ndiscuss how they have much wider applicability in terms of portfolio\noptimisation.\n  We use an enhanced indexation approach based on second-order stochastic\ndominance. We consider index options for the S\\&P~500, using a dataset of daily\nstock prices over the period 2017-2025 that has been manually adjusted to\naccount for survivorship bias. This dataset is made publicly available for use\nby future researchers.\n  Our computational results indicate that introducing option strategies in an\nenhanced indexation setting offers clear benefits in terms of improved\nout-of-sample performance.

Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here\nwe introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding\nprobability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace\noperators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods\nand overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an\nintegral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly\napproximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\noffering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high\ndimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using\neigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and\noptimization.

This paper investigates\nthe anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we\ninstructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated\nnegotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.\nExperimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like\nhumans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring\neffect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that\nreasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the\nlong chain of thought mitigates the effect.

The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,\nrooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest\nin applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.\nHere, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from\nbiological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We\nevaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological\nchallenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior\nknowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved\nvariable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.\nUpon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic\nregression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight\nthe emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable\ninnovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency\nof such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all\nchallenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from\nhybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based\nmechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative\nand knowledge integration capacities of deep learning.

In this\npaper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically\nexploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly\noverfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose\nGenerative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally\nefficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,\nformulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a\nsurrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic\ndata. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model\narchitectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently\ndominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.\nThese results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for\nthe release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed\nby generative model overfitting in real-world applications."}

For\nexample, notable claims include that a single training example can match the\nperformance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not\nneed to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can\nmatch or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise\nconditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they\nfail - remain unclear.

Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of\ncounterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across\ndifferent model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while\nstandard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these\ncounterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit\nstrong model-task alignment.

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated\ngating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three\nheterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable\nmulti-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph\nneural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution\nnetwork. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative\nresults demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2\nprediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most\naccurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities.

LRP propagates the network's output backward through the\nlayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local\npropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only\ntwo forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency\nwhile improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and\ntasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than\nstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and\nMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for\nMLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by\nRelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits\nidentified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves\ncomparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with\nIG."}

Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance\ndegradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical\nproperties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM\n(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for\nreal-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built\non the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm\nfoundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's\nnovelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,\ncontinuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to\nadapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an\nLLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,\ncontext-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training\ndataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful\npattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our\nresults demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC\nscore in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,\nvalidating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining\nhigh-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments."}

However, these methods face challenges related to data\nprivacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are\ndissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding\nGenerative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired\nby the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the \"wake\" phase, the system rapidly\nlearns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,\nG-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the \"sleep\" phase, the system\nenters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data\n(\"dreams\") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor\nvia knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw\ndata, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant\nadvantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer\nvision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)\nbenchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline.

To overcome this limitation, machine\nunlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove\nsensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.\nRecently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by\nintegrating LoRA adapters.

A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from\nits K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some\ntokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation\nby selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average\nreconstruction but risks an \"activation lottery,\" where rare high-magnitude\nfeatures crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this\nissue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)\nof the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate\npool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch\nfrom the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between\nbatch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$\nglobally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward\nstandard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$\nthus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.\nOn Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best\nchoice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction\nfidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a\ntunable, distribution-aware family."}

However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over\nextended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task\nof generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series\nexhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also\nundergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term\ndependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the\nother hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships\nbetween different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing\nboth intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important\nchallenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative\nmodel for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through\nstage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model\npreserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data\ndistribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence\ndecomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different\ntime scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel\nfusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent\nmodeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,\neffectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of\nlong-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation\ntasks."}

One\nkey insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that\nwide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)\npromote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in\ninput data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise\ninto an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD\nconsistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like\nMNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN.

This method transforms the network data into a\nmodel within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's\nperformance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on\nthese proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this\napproach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the\nreservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.\nData from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated\nform with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted\nnetwork. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks\nas a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state\nnetwork (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on\nwhich a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep\nneural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use\nneuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then\nshow how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how\nit visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as\nproof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time\nmonitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile\ncommunication networks as well as transportation networks."}

Thus, in many applications, optimizing\nthe long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.\nIn this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard\nensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term\nperformance of individual trajectories.

The assessment framework encompasses\ndistinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to\nobjectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of\nphysiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine\nlearning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive\nutility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and\ninterval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection\nangle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to\nelucidate sex-specific influences.

The results demonstrate\nthat the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with\nreference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust\nclassification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific\ndeterminants affecting signal acquisition.

This paper evaluates PINNs'\ncapabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their\nperformance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three\nkey experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory\nprediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions\n(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we\ndemonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in\nerror reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic\ngrid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and\nexpert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic\nperformance.

Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4\ntimes improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With\ncontinuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds\npotential to exploit such advances. Project Website:\nhttps://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website"}

We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked\nto navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to\ntargets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead\nto deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only\nprovides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees\nnon-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of\ninterest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\\times K}$ cost structure that\ndescribes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport\nthen provides \\textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the\nrobots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling\nconsiderations. The proposed solution requires $\\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\\log K)$\ncomputations in the worst-case and $\\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\\log K)$ for\nwell-behaved problems.

However, their effectiveness deteriorates for\nlow signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge\ndevices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within\nthe limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram\n(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by\nartefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a\nparadigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence\nof filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter\ndesign as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design\nsignal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing\nkey patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong\npotential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as\ndemonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state\nclassification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The\nproposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that\nrequire accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals."}

This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR.

To better\nassess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP\nencounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating\non 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after\nfine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'\nsome domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance\ndeteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present\nCLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware\nrepresentations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while\nstandard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,\nthis can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of\ndomain-aware representations beneficial for generalization.

Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated\nwith ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential\ntreatments that are informatively timed.
