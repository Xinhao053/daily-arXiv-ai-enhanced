While prior works have established gap-dependent regret bounds in this setting, existing analyses do not apply to algorithms that achieve the nearly minimax-optimal worst-case regret bound $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{H^3K})$, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the horizon length, and $K$ is the number of episodes. We bridge this gap by providing the first gap-dependent regret bound for the nearly minimax-optimal algorithm LSVI-UCB++ (He et al., 2023). Our analysis yields improved dependencies on both $d$ and $H$ compared to previous gap-dependent results. Moreover, leveraging the low policy-switching property of LSVI-UCB++, we introduce a concurrent variant that enables efficient parallel exploration across multiple agents and establish the first gap-dependent sample complexity upper bound for online multi-agent RL with linear function approximation, achieving linear speedup with respect to the number of agents."}

Out-of-sample, the SDF consistently outperforms self-predictive and expected-return benchmarks across investment universes and market states. The inferred information network highlights large, low-turnover firms as net transmitters. The framework offers a clear, economically grounded view of the informational architecture underlying cross-sectional return dynamics."}

If P = NP, firms can efficiently solve the collusion detection problem, identifying deviations from cooperative agreements in complex, noisy markets and thereby making collusion sustainable as an equilibrium. If P != NP, the collusion detection problem is computationally infeasible for markets satisfying a natural instance-hardness condition on their demand structure, rendering punishment threats non-credible and collusion unstable. Combined with Maymin (2011), who proved that market efficiency requires P = NP, this yields a fundamental impossibility: markets can be informationally efficient or competitive, but not both. Artificial intelligence, by expanding firms' computational capabilities, is pushing markets from the competitive regime toward the collusive regime, explaining the empirical emergence of algorithmic collusion without explicit coordination."}

It is worth mentioning that, by introducing two metrics: the size tuple and the dimension vector, we provide a fine-grained characterization of Transformer structures, which facilitates future research on the generalization and optimization errors of Transformers with different structures. As intermediate results, we also derive the upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant of standard Transformers and their memorization capacity, which may be of independent interest. These findings provide theoretical justification for the powerful capabilities of Transformer models."}

We develop Bayesian Parametric Portfolio Policies (BPPP), which place a prior on policy coefficients thereby correcting the decision rule. We derive a general result showing that the utility gap between PPP and BPPP is strictly positive and proportional to posterior parameter uncertainty and signal magnitude. Under a mean--variance approximation, this correction appears as an additional estimation-risk term in portfolio variance, implying that PPP overexposes when signals are strongest and when risk aversion is high. Empirically, in a high-dimensional setting with 242 signals and six factors over 1973--2023, BPPP delivers higher Sharpe ratios, substantially lower turnover, larger investor welfare, and lower tail risk, with advantages that increase monotonically in risk aversion and are strongest during crisis episodes."}

Several celebrated results in statistical learning theory, such as the VC theorem and Littlestone's characterization of online learnability, establish conditions on the hypothesis class that allow for learning under independent data and adversarial data, respectively. Building upon recent work bridging these extremes, we study sequential decision making under distributional adversaries that can adaptively choose data-generating distributions from a fixed family $U$ and ask when such problems are learnable with sample complexity that behaves like the favorable independent case. We provide a near complete characterization of families $U$ that admit learnability in terms of a notion known as generalized smoothness i.e. a distribution family admits VC-dimension-dependent regret bounds for every finite-VC hypothesis class if and only if it is generalized smooth. Further, we give universal algorithms that achieve low regret under any generalized smooth adversary without explicit knowledge of $U$. Finally, when $U$ is known, we provide refined bounds in terms of a combinatorial parameter, the fragmentation number, that captures how many disjoint regions can carry nontrivial mass under $U$. These results provide a nearly complete understanding of learnability under distributional adversaries. In addition, building upon the surprising connection between online learning and differential privacy, we show that the generalized smoothness also characterizes private learnability under distributional constraints."}

Our approach employs a tensor network Born machine based on automatically differentiable matrix product states (MPS) as the generative model, using the Born rule to define probability distributions over candidate solutions. Unlike approaches based on binary encoding, which require $N^2$ variables and penalty terms to enforce valid tour constraints, we adopt a permutation-based formulation with integer variables and use autoregressive sampling with masking to guarantee that every generated sample is a valid tour by construction. We also introduce a $k$-site MPS variant that learns distributions over $k$-grams (consecutive city subsequences) using a sliding window approach, enabling parameter-efficient modeling for larger instances. Experimental validation on TSPLIB benchmark instances with up to 52 cities demonstrates that TN-GEO can outperform classical heuristics including swap and 2-opt hill-climbing. The $k$-site variants, which put more focus on local correlations, show better results compared to the full-MPS case."}

In this work, we attribute the source of varying calibration parameters to the varying token-level sensitivity caused by a precision-dependent outlier migration phenomenon.Motivated by this observation, we propose \\texttt{MoBiQuant}, a novel Mixture-of-Bits quantization framework that adjusts weight precision for elastic LLM inference based on token sensitivity.

Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that learning across $k$ distributions inherently incurs slow rates scaling with $k/ε^2$, even under constant noise levels, unless each distribution is learned separately.

However, during RL training, the enormous state space of MLLM and sparse rewards often leads to entropy collapse, policy degradation, or over-exploitation of suboptimal behaviors. This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction. CalibRL increases policy entropy in a guided manner and clarifies the target distribution by estimating the on-policy distribution through online sampling. Updates are driven by these informative behaviors, avoiding convergence to erroneous patterns. Importantly, these designs help alleviate the distributional mismatch between the model's policy and expert trajectories, thereby achieving a more stable balance between exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrate consistent improvements, validating the effectiveness of our controllable hybrid-policy RLVR training.

The original algorithm uses linear combinations of variables in a tree structure where depth is constrained to be less than the number of classes -- a limitation that proves too rigid for complex classification problems. Our extensions improve performance in multi-class settings with unequal variance-covariance structures and nonlinear class separations by allowing more splits and more flexible class groupings in the projection pursuit computation. Proposing algorithmic improvements is straightforward; demonstrating their actual utility is not. We therefore develop two visual diagnostic approaches to verify that the enhancements perform as intended. Using high-dimensional visualization techniques, we examine model fits on benchmark datasets to assess whether the algorithm behaves as theorized. An interactive web application enables users to explore the behavior of both the original and enhanced classifiers under controlled scenarios. The enhancements are implemented in the R package PPtreeExt."}

Although widely studied in binary classification, these issues remain underexplored in multi-class settings, where complex inter-class relationships make minority-majority structures unclear and traditional clustering fails to capture distribution shape. Approaches that rely only on geometric distances risk removing informative samples and generating low-quality synthetic data, while binarization approaches treat imbalance locally and ignore global inter-class dependencies. At the algorithmic level, ensembles struggle to integrate weak classifiers, leading to limited robustness. This paper proposes IMOVNO+ (IMbalance-OVerlap-NOise+ Algorithm-Level Optimization), a two-level framework designed to jointly enhance data quality and algorithmic robustness for binary and multi-class tasks. At the data level, first, conditional probability is used to quantify the informativeness of each sample. Second, the dataset is partitioned into core, overlapping, and noisy regions. Third, an overlapping-cleaning algorithm is introduced that combines Z-score metrics with a big-jump gap distance. Fourth, a smart oversampling algorithm based on multi-regularization controls synthetic sample proximity, preventing new overlaps. At the algorithmic level, a meta-heuristic prunes ensemble classifiers to reduce weak-learner influence. IMOVNO+ was evaluated on 35 datasets (13 multi-class, 22 binary). Results show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods, approaching 100% in several cases. For multi-class data, IMOVNO+ achieves gains of 37-57% in G-mean, 25-44% in F1-score, 25-39% in precision, and 26-43% in recall. In binary tasks, it attains near-perfect performance with improvements of 14-39%. The framework handles data scarcity and imbalance from collection and privacy limits."}

We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=σ_k^{2}/(2μ_k)$, with $μ_k{=}\\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $σ_k^2{=}\\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/μ_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\\sum_k C_k \\approx \\mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\\% over MI and 56.2\\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured."}

This process typically involves two stages: identifying the layer to edit and performing the parameter update. Intuitively, different queries may localize knowledge at different depths of the model, resulting in different sample-wise editing performance for a fixed editing layer. In this work, we hypothesize the existence of fixed golden layers that can achieve near-optimal editing performance similar to sample-wise optimal layers. To validate this hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence by comparing golden layers against ground-truth sample-wise optimal layers. Furthermore, we show that golden layers can be reliably identified using a proxy dataset and generalize effectively to unseen test set queries across datasets. Finally, we propose a novel method, namely Layer Gradient Analysis (LGA) that estimates golden layers efficiently via gradient-attribution, avoiding extensive trial-and-error across multiple editing runs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our LGA approach across different LLM types and various knowledge editing methods."}

Our approach leverages multiple randomized trials to assess whether treatment effects vary with unobserved heterogeneity that differs across trials: if CATEs are homogeneous, this indicates the absence of interactions between treatment and unobservables in the mean effect. Comparing CATEs between experimental and observational data further allows evaluation of potential confounding: if the estimands coincide, there is no unobserved confounding; if they differ, deviations may arise from unobserved confounding, effect heterogeneity, or both. We extend the framework to settings with alternative identification strategies, namely instrumental variable settings and panel data with parallel trends assumptions based on differences in differences, where effects are identified only locally for subpopulations such as compliers or treated units. In these contexts, testing homogeneity is useful for assessing whether local effects can be extrapolated to the total population. We suggest a test based on double machine learning that accommodates high-dimensional covariates in a data-driven way and investigate its finite-sample performance through a simulation study. Finally, we apply the test to the International Stroke Trial (IST), a large multi-country randomized controlled trial in patients with acute ischaemic stroke that evaluated whether early treatment with aspirin altered subsequent clinical outcomes. Our methodology provides a flexible tool for both validating identification assumptions and understanding the generalizability of estimated treatment effects."}

In this paper, we propose ESM (Essential Subspace Merging) , a robust framework for effective model merging. We begin by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on feature shifts induced by parameter updates. The resulting principal directions span an essential subspace that dominantly influences feature representations. Each task's parameter update matrix is projected onto its respective essential subspace for low-rank decomposition before merging. This methodology mitigates inter-task interference while preserving core task-specific functionality. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level polarized scaling strategy that amplifies parameters containing critical knowledge and suppresses redundant ones, preventing essential knowledge from being overwhelmed during fusion.

We propose a federated framework for estimating a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) hazard model of bridge deterioration, enabling municipalities to collaboratively train a shared benchmark model without transferring raw inspection records. Each User holds local inspection data and trains a log-linear hazard model over three deterioration-direction transitions -- Good$\\to$Minor, Good$\\to$Severe, and Minor$\\to$Severe -- with covariates for bridge age, coastline distance, and deck area. Local optimization is performed via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent on the CTMC log-likelihood, and only a 12-dimensional pseudo-gradient vector is uploaded to a central server per communication round. The server aggregates User updates using sample-weighted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with momentum and gradient clipping. All experiments in this paper are conducted on fully synthetic data generated from a known ground-truth parameter set with region-specific heterogeneity, enabling controlled evaluation of federated convergence behaviour. Simulation results across heterogeneous Users show consistent convergence of the average negative log-likelihood, with the aggregated gradient norm decreasing as User scale increases. Furthermore, the federated update mechanism provides a natural participation incentive: Users who register their local inspection datasets on a shared technical-standard platform receive in return the periodically updated global benchmark parameters -- information that cannot be obtained from local data alone -- thereby enabling evidence-based life-cycle planning without surrendering data sovereignty."}

Second, we address the main computational bottleneck, which is the repeated solution of worst-case expectation problems. For the important class of piecewise concave loss functions, we propose a tailored algorithm that exploits problem geometry to achieve substantial speedups over state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi. The key insight is a novel connection between the worst-case expectation problem, an inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problem, and a classical and tractable budget allocation problem, which is of independent interest."}

However, it struggles to integrate heterogeneous modalities such as images and text, which are common in domains like healthcare and marketing, thereby limiting its applicability. To address this, we present the Multi-Modal Prior-data Fitted Network (MMPFN), which extends TabPFN to handle tabular and non-tabular modalities in a unified manner. MMPFN comprises per-modality encoders, modality projectors, and pre-trained foundation models. The modality projectors serve as the critical bridge, transforming non-tabular embeddings into tabular-compatible tokens for unified processing. To this end, we introduce a multi-head gated MLP and a cross-attention pooler that extract richer context from non-tabular inputs while mitigates attention imbalance issue in multimodal learning. Extensive experiments on medical and general-purpose multimodal datasets demonstrate that MMPFN consistently outperforms competitive state-of-the-art methods and effectively exploits non-tabular modalities alongside tabular features. These results highlight the promise of extending prior-data fitted networks to the multimodal setting, offering a scalable and effective framework for heterogeneous data learning.

While convergence properties of such methods are well understood, their finite-iteration stability and generalization behavior remain unclear due to structural bias induced by column-stochastic mixing and asymmetric error propagation. In this work, we develop a unified uniform-stability framework for the Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) algorithm that captures the effect of directed topology. A key technical ingredient is an imbalance-aware consistency bound for Push-Sum, which controls consensus deviation through two quantities: the stationary distribution imbalance parameter $δ$ and the spectral gap $(1-λ)$ governing mixing speed. This decomposition enables us to disentangle statistical effects from topology-induced bias. We establish finite-iteration stability and optimization guarantees for both convex objectives and non-convex objectives satisfying the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition. For convex problems, SGP attains excess generalization error of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{mn}}+\\fracγ{δ(1-λ)}+γ\\right)$ under step-size schedules, and we characterize the corresponding optimal early stopping time that minimizes this bound.

Yet the increasing complexity of logistics networks, spanning multimodal transportation, cross-country routing, and pronounced regional variability, makes this prediction task inherently challenging. This paper introduces a multi-task deep learning model for delivery delay duration prediction in the presence of significant imbalanced data, where delayed shipments are rare but operationally consequential. The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions."}

However, GPs capable of jointly handling functional covariates and multiple correlated functional tasks remain largely under-explored. In this work, we extend the framework of GPs with functional covariates to multitask problems by introducing a fully separable kernel structure that captures dependencies across tasks and functional inputs. By taking advantage of the Kronecker structure of the covariance matrix, the model is made scalable. The proposed model is validated on a synthetic benchmark and applied to a realistic structure, a riveted assembly with functional descriptions of the material behaviour and response forces. The proposed functional multitask GP significantly improves over single task GPs. For the riveted assembly, it requires less than 100 samples to produce an accurate mean and confidence interval prediction.

We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies. Together, our results support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist in representational space, with post-training reshaping their geometry.

Rather than approximating a discrete analog of a score function, our formulation treats single-site conditional probabilities as the fundamental objects that parameterize the reverse diffusion process. We employ a sample-efficient method known as Neural Interaction Screening Estimator (NeurISE) to estimate these conditionals in the diffusion dynamics. Controlled experiments on synthetic Ising models, MNIST, and scientific data sets produced by a D-Wave quantum annealer, synthetic Potts model and one-dimensional quantum systems demonstrate the proposed approach. On the binary data sets, these experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms popular existing methods including ratio-based approaches, achieving improved performance in total variation, cross-correlations, and kernel density estimation metrics."}

Applying it to 28,606 books in PG19 (pre-1920 English literature), I compute paragraph-level novelty curves using 768-dimensional SBERT embeddings, then reduce each to a 16-segment Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). Ward-linkage clustering on PAA vectors reveals eight canonical narrative shape archetypes, from Steep Descent (rapid convergence) to Steep Ascent (escalating unpredictability). Volume--variance of the novelty trajectory--is the strongest length-independent predictor of readership (partial rho = 0.32), followed by speed (rho = 0.19) and Terminal/Initial ratio (rho = 0.19). Circuitousness shows strong raw correlation (rho = 0.41) but is 93 percent correlated with length; after control, partial rho drops to 0.11--demonstrating that naive correlations in corpus studies can be dominated by length confounds. Genre strongly constrains narrative shape (chi squared = 2121.6, p < 10 to the power negative 242), with fiction maintaining plateau profiles while nonfiction front-loads information. Historical analysis shows books became progressively more predictable between 1840 and 1910 (T/I ratio trend r = negative 0.74, p = 0.037). SAX analysis reveals 85 percent signature uniqueness, suggesting each book traces a nearly unique path through semantic space. These findings demonstrate that information-density dynamics, distinct from sentiment or topic, constitute a fundamental dimension of narrative structure with measurable consequences for reader engagement.

However, existing methods face a critical trade-off: conventional functional models are limited by linearity, whereas deep learning approaches lack interpretable region selection for sparse effects. To bridge these gaps, we propose a sparse Bayesian functional deep neural network (sBayFDNN). It learns adaptive functional embeddings through a deep Bayesian architecture to capture complex nonlinear relationships, while a structured prior enables interpretable, region-wise selection of influential domains with quantified uncertainty. Theoretically, we establish rigorous approximation error bounds, posterior consistency, and region selection consistency. These results provide the first theoretical guarantees for a Bayesian deep functional model, ensuring its reliability and statistical rigor. Empirically, comprehensive simulations and real-world studies confirm the effectiveness and superiority of sBayFDNN. Crucially, sBayFDNN excels in recognizing intricate dependencies for accurate predictions and more precisely identifies functionally meaningful regions, capabilities fundamentally beyond existing approaches."}

In this paper we investigate goodness-of-fit and two-sample testing procedures for statistical networks based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt). Our approach formulates a constrained entropy-maximization problem on the space of networks, subject to prescribed structural constraints. The resulting test statistics are defined through the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constrained optimization problem, which, to our knowledge, is novel in the statistical networks literature.\n  We establish consistency in the classical regime where the number of vertices is fixed. We then consider asymptotic regimes in which the graph size grows with the sample size, developing tests for both dense and sparse settings. In the dense case, we analyze exponential random graph models (ERGM) (including the Erdös-Rènyi models), while in the sparse regime our theory applies to Erd{ö}s-R{è}nyi graphs.\n  Our analysis leverages recent advances in nonlinear large deviation theory for random graphs. We further show that the proposed Lagrange-multiplier framework connects naturally to classical score tests for constrained maximum likelihood estimation. The results provide a unified entropy-based framework for network model assessment across diverse growth regimes."}

Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, but generalization across diverse anatomies is challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. We propose a two-step framework that decouples geometric representation from learning the physics response, to enable shape-informed surrogate modeling under data-scarce conditions. First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds. Overall, our results, obtained on idealized and patient-specific datasets, show that the proposed approaches allow for accurate predictions and generalization to unseen geometries, and robustness to noisy or sparsely sampled inputs."}

Under suitable assumptions, we rigorously establish convergence of our method to the stationary points of the asymptotic log-likelihood of the interacting particle system. We consider asymptotics both in the limit as the time horizon $t\\rightarrow\\infty$, for a fixed and finite number of particles, and in the joint limit as the number of particles $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ and the time horizon $t\\rightarrow\\infty$. Under additional assumptions on the asymptotic log-likelihood, we also establish an $\\mathrm{L}^2$ convergence rate and a central limit theorem. Finally, we present several numerical examples of practical interest, including a model for systemic risk, a model of interacting FitzHugh--Nagumo neurons, and a Cucker--Smale flocking model. Our numerical results corroborate our theoretical results, and also suggest that our estimator is effective even in cases where the assumptions required for our theoretical analysis do not hold."}

QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints."}

Existing models capture features by learning from large corpora with transformer models, which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. Therefore, our proposed study incorporates comprehensive grammatical rules alongside semantic information to build a robust, lightweight classification model without resorting to full parameterised transformer models or heavy deep learning architectures. The novelty of our approach lies in its explicit encoding of sentence-level grammatical structure, including syntactic composition, phrase patterns, and complexity indicators, into a compact grammar vector, which is then fused with frozen contextual embeddings. These heterogeneous elements unified a single representation that captures both the structural and semantic characteristics of the text. Deep learning models such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), BiLSTMs, and transformer-based BERT and XLNET were used to train and evaluate the model, with the number of epochs varied. Based on experimental results, the unified feature representation model captures both the semantic and structural properties of text, outperforming baseline models by 2%-15%, enabling more effective learning across heterogeneous domains. Unlike prior syntax-aware transformer models that inject grammatical structure through additional attention layers, tree encoders, or full fine-tuning, the proposed framework treats grammar as an explicit inductive bias rather than a learnable module, resulting in a very lightweight model that delivers better performance on edge devices"}

Existing models capture features by learning from large corpora with transformer models, which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. Therefore, our proposed study incorporates comprehensive grammatical rules alongside semantic information to build a robust, lightweight classification model without resorting to full parameterised transformer models or heavy deep learning architectures. The novelty of our approach lies in its explicit encoding of sentence-level grammatical structure, including syntactic composition, phrase patterns, and complexity indicators, into a compact grammar vector, which is then fused with frozen contextual embeddings. These heterogeneous elements unified a single representation that captures both the structural and semantic characteristics of the text. Deep learning models such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), BiLSTMs, and transformer-based BERT and XLNET were used to train and evaluate the model, with the number of epochs varied. Based on experimental results, the unified feature representation model captures both the semantic and structural properties of text, outperforming baseline models by 2%-15%, enabling more effective learning across heterogeneous domains. Unlike prior syntax-aware transformer models that inject grammatical structure through additional attention layers, tree encoders, or full fine-tuning, the proposed framework treats grammar as an explicit inductive bias rather than a learnable module, resulting in a very lightweight model that delivers better performance on edge devices"}

Even with false discovery rate (FDR) control procedures, they often fail to provide frequentist guarantees in practice. We highlight two common failure modes: (i) in small samples, asymptotic guarantees for many CITs can be inaccurate and even correctly specified models fail to estimate the noise levels and control the error, and (ii) when sample sizes are large but models are misspecified, unaccounted dependencies skew the test's behavior and fail to return uniform p-values under the null. We propose Empirically Calibrated Conditional Independence Tests (ECCIT), a method that measures and corrects for miscalibration. For a chosen base CIT (e.g., GCM, HRT), ECCIT optimizes an adversary that selects features and response functions to maximize a miscalibration metric. ECCIT then fits a monotone calibration map that adjusts the base-test p-values in proportion to the observed miscalibration. Across empirical benchmarks on synthetic and real data, ECCIT achieves valid FDR with higher power than existing calibration strategies while remaining test agnostic."}

We investigate these dynamics by applying Manifold Capacity Theory (MCT) to a compositional Boolean logic task, allowing us to quantify the linear separability of latent representations without the confounding factors of probe training. Our analysis reveals that reasoning manifests as a transient geometric pulse, where concept manifolds are untangled into linearly separable subspaces immediately prior to computation and rapidly compressed thereafter. This behavior diverges from standard linear probe accuracy, which remains high long after computation, suggesting a fundamental distinction between information that is merely retrievable and information that is geometrically prepared for processing.

The result is a network whose edge dependency structure violates the assumptions of most common network models. Nonetheless, it is common to analyze these \"correlation networks\" using embedding methods derived from edge-independent network models, based on a belief that the edges are approximately independent. In this work, we put this modeling choice on firm theoretical ground. We show that when the time series are expressible in terms of a small number of Fourier basis elements (or in some other suitably-chosen basis), correlation networks correspond to latent space networks with dependent edge noise in which the vertex-level latent variables encode the basis coefficients. Further, we show that when time series are observed subject to noise, spectral embedding of the resulting noisy correlation network still recovers these true vertex-level latent representations under suitable assumptions. This characterization of embeddings as learning Fourier coefficients appears to be folklore in the signal processing community in the context of principal component analysis, but is, to the best of our knowledge, new to the statistical network analysis literature."}

In this work, we propose Graph Semantic Predictive Network (GraSPNet), a hierarchical self-supervised framework that explicitly models both atomic-level and fragment-level semantics. GraSPNet decomposes molecular graphs into chemically meaningful fragments without predefined vocabularies and learns node- and fragment-level representations through multi-level message passing with masked semantic prediction at both levels.

We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints. We focus on human motion generation - a domain where kinematic structure, smooth temporal continuity, and interactive use cases (choreography, rehabilitation, HCI) make topology-aware control especially natural - demonstrating controlled divergence and convergence from reference sequences through simple grid-based sampling.

MG extrapolates the current velocity using an exponential moving average of past velocities and preserves the standard one-evaluation-per-step cost. It matches the effect of standard guidance without extra computation and can further improve quality when combined with CFG. Experiments demonstrate MG's effectiveness across benchmarks.

Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \\log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces."}

Later works in approximation theory provide quantitative approximation rates for ReLU networks on the class of $α$-Hölder functions $f: [0,1]^N \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The goal of this paper is to provide similar quantitative approximation results in the context of group equivariant learning, where the learned $α$-Hölder function is known to obey certain group symmetries. While there has been much interest in the literature in understanding the universal approximation properties of equivariant models, very few quantitative approximation results are known for equivariant models.\n  In this paper, we bridge this gap by deriving quantitative approximation rates for several prominent group-equivariant and invariant architectures. The architectures that we consider include: the permutation-invariant Deep Sets architecture; the permutation-equivariant Sumformer and Transformer architectures; joint invariance to permutations and rigid motions using invariant networks based on frame averaging; and general bi-Lipschitz invariant models. Overall, we show that equally-sized ReLU MLPs and equivariant architectures are equally expressive over equivariant functions.

Considering the widespread technique of Shapley values, we find that purely data-driven operationalization of multivariate feature importance is unsuitable for such purposes. Even for simple problems with two features, spurious associations due to collider bias and suppression arise from considering one feature only in the observational context of the other, which can lead to misinterpretations. Causal knowledge about the data-generating process is required to identify and correct such misleading feature attributions. We propose cc-Shapley (causal context Shapley), an interventional modification of conventional observational Shapley values leveraging knowledge of the data's causal structure, thereby analyzing the relevance of a feature in the causal context of the remaining features. We show theoretically that this eradicates spurious association induced by collider bias. We compare the behavior of Shapley and cc-Shapley values on various, synthetic, and real-world datasets. We observe nullification or reversal of associations compared to univariate feature importance when moving from observational to cc-Shapley."}

First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse.

Pre-trained on over one million samples, GeoPT consistently improves industrial-fidelity benchmarks spanning fluid mechanics for cars, aircraft, and ships, and solid mechanics in crash simulation, reducing labeled data requirements by 20-60% and accelerating convergence by 2$\\times$. These results show that lifting with synthetic dynamics bridges the geometry-physics gap, unlocking a scalable path for neural simulation and potentially beyond.

To address this issue, efficient reasoning aims to incentivize short yet accurate thinking trajectories, typically through reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization."}

Although techniques from both paradigms have been shown to improve model accuracy on a wide variety of tasks, we argue that the datasets used for these evaluations could cause overoptimistic evaluation results. Unlike many real-world datasets, they often (1) have no features with more salience than truthfulness, (2) have balanced training sets, and (3) contain only data points to which the model can give a well-defined answer. We construct datasets that lack each of these properties to stress-test a range of standard unsupervised elicitation and easy-to-hard generalization techniques. We find that no technique reliably performs well on any of these challenges. We also study ensembling and combining easy-to-hard and unsupervised techniques, and find they only partially mitigate performance degradation due to these challenges. We believe that overcoming these challenges should be a priority for future work on unsupervised elicitation."}

In this paper, we address these challenges. First, we formulate the problem as an online saddle-point stochastic game between a decision maker and an adversary selecting worst-case distributions, and propose a general framework that converges to a robust Nash equilibrium coinciding with the solution of the corresponding offline Wasserstein DRO problem. Second, we address the main computational bottleneck, which is the repeated solution of worst-case expectation problems. For the important class of piecewise concave loss functions, we propose a tailored algorithm that exploits problem geometry to achieve substantial speedups over state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi. The key insight is a novel connection between the worst-case expectation problem, an inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problem, and a classical and tractable budget allocation problem, which is of independent interest."}

Consequently, accurate model estimation depends on how the exploration policy allocates visitation frequencies in accordance with the intrinsic complexity of each transition distribution. Building on recent work on coverage-based exploration, we introduce a parameterized family of decomposable and concave objective functions $U_κ$ that explicitly incorporate both intrinsic estimation complexity and extrinsic visitation frequency. Moreover, the curvature $κ$ provides a unified treatment of various global objectives, such as the average-case and worst-case estimation error objectives. Using the closed-form characterization of the gradient of $U_κ$, we propose $κ$-Explorer, an active exploration algorithm that performs Frank-Wolfe-style optimization over state-action occupancy measures. The diminishing-returns structure of $U_κ$ naturally prioritizes underexplored and high-variance transitions, while preserving smoothness properties that enable efficient optimization. We establish tight regret guarantees for $κ$-Explorer and further introduce a fully online and computationally efficient surrogate algorithm for practical use. Experiments on benchmark MDPs demonstrate that $κ$-Explorer provides superior performance compared to existing exploration strategies."}

However, deploying large-scale GNN models locally is particularly challenging for users, as it requires significant computational resources and extensive property data. Consequently, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become increasingly popular, offering a convenient way to deploy and access various models, including GNNs. However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality. Specifically, attackers repeatedly query the target model using subgraph inputs to collect corresponding responses. These input-output pairs are subsequently utilized to train their own surrogate models at minimal cost.

However, EHRs are often sparse and contain missing data due to various challenges and limitations in data collection and sharing between healthcare providers. Existing techniques for imputing missing values predominantly focus on known unknowns, such as missing or unavailable values of lab test results; most do not explicitly address situations where it is difficult to distinguish what is missing. For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs. We design a transformer-based denoising neural network where the output is thresholded adaptively to recover values in cases where we predict data are missing. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in denoising medical codes within a real EHR dataset compared to existing imputation approaches and leads to increased performance on downstream tasks using the denoised data. In particular, when applying our method to a real world application, predicting hospital readmission from EHRs, our method achieves statistically significant improvement over all existing baselines."}

We address this gap through a systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, a large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, a family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2.0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2.5% to 13.0% Nemotron-Terminal-14B improves from 4.0% to 20.2%, and Nemotron-Terminal-32B improves from 3.4% to 27.4%, matching the performance of significantly larger models.

However, the learning process tends to be costly. To address this, we present a novel paradigm named Attention Neural Teaching (AtteNT) that reinterprets the learning process through a nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the latter provides a theoretical framework for teaching mappings that are implicitly defined (i.e., nonparametric) via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is embodied through a dense set of sequence-property pairs, with the AtteNT teacher selecting a subset to accelerate convergence in attention learner training. By analytically investigating the role of attention on parameter-based gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of attention learners, shaped by parameter updates, through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching attention learners is consistent with teaching importance-adaptive nonparametric learners. These new findings readily commit AtteNT to enhancing learning efficiency of attention learners. Specifically, we observe training time reductions of 13.01% for LLMs and 20.58% for ViTs, spanning both fine-tuning and training-from-scratch regimes. Crucially, these gains are achieved without compromising accuracy; in fact, performance is consistently preserved and often enhanced across a diverse set of downstream tasks."}

Pruning techniques affirmed themselves as valid tools to extract sparse representations of neural networks parameters, carefully balancing between compression and preservation of information. However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity? Our work introduces a novel pruning method in which the importance measure of each weight is computed considering the output behavior after an optimal perturbation of its adjacent bias, efficiently computable by automatic differentiation. These perturbations can be then applied directly after the removal of each weight, independently of each other. After deriving analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities, numerical experiments are conducted to benchmark this technique against some of the most popular pruning strategies, demonstrating an intrinsic efficiency of the proposed approach in very diverse machine learning scenarios.

However, the evolving inter-variable dependencies and inevitable noise render it challenging. Existing methods often use single-scale graphs or instance-level contrast. Moreover, learned dynamic graphs can overfit noise without a stable anchor, causing false alarms or misses. To address these challenges, we propose the CGSTA framework with two key innovations. First, Dynamic Layered Graph Construction (DLGC) forms local, regional, and global views of variable relations for each sliding window; rather than contrasting whole windows, Contrastive Discrimination across Scales (CDS) contrasts graph representations within each view and aligns the same window across views to make learning structure-aware. Second, Stability-Aware Alignment (SAA) maintains a per-scale stable reference learned from normal data and guides the current window's fast-changing graphs toward it to suppress noise. We fuse the multi-scale and temporal features and use a conditional density estimator to produce per-time-step anomaly scores. Across four benchmarks, CGSTA delivers optimal performance on PSM and WADI, and is comparable to the baseline methods on SWaT and SMAP."}

In this paper, we revisit these architectures from both theoretical and practical perspectives and address a key gap in the literature: the lack of theoretical guarantees on approximation quality under realistic assumptions, whether for posterior inference in INNs or for generative modeling with NFs.\n  We introduce a unified framework for INNs and NFs based on variational unsupervised loss functions, inspired by analogous formulations in related areas such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the Precision-Recall divergence for training normalizing flows. Within this framework, we derive theoretical performance guarantees, quantifying posterior accuracy for INNs and distributional accuracy for NFs, under assumptions that are weaker and more practically realistic than those used in prior work.\n  Building on these theoretical results, we conduct extensive case studies to distill general design principles and practical guidelines. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on a realistic ocean-acoustic inversion problem."}

To address these issues in a fully decentralized scenario, we first propose a sparse-and-orthogonal LoRA that ensures orthogonality between model updates to eliminate direction conflicts during fine-tuning.Then, we analyze how device connection topology affects multi-task performance, prompting a cluster-based topology design during aggregation.Finally, we propose an implicit mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism to avoid the coexistence of incompatible knowledge during inference.

In contrast, Apprenticeship Learning (AL) uses a few expert demonstrations to infer the expert's underlying reward functions and derive decision-making policies that generalize and replicate optimal behavior. In this work, we leverage a generalized AL framework, THEMES, to induce effective pedagogical policies by capturing the complexities of the expert student learning process, where multiple reward functions may dynamically evolve over time. We evaluate the effectiveness of THEMES against six state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its superior performance and highlighting its potential as a powerful alternative for inducing effective pedagogical policies and show that it can achieve high performance, with an AUC of 0.899 and a Jaccard of 0.653, using only 18 trajectories of a previous semester to predict student pedagogical decisions in a later semester."}

Real-world human emotional experiences, by contrast, are often characterized by the simultaneous presence of multiple affective states, spurring recent interest in mixed emotion recognition as an emotion distribution learning problem. Current approaches, however, often neglect the valence consistency and structured correlations inherent among coexisting emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a Memory-guided Prototypical Co-occurrence Learning (MPCL) framework that explicitly models emotion co-occurrence patterns. Specifically, we first fuse multi-modal signals via a multi-scale associative memory mechanism. To capture cross-modal semantic relationships, we construct emotion-specific prototype memory banks, yielding rich physiological and behavioral representations, and employ prototype relation distillation to ensure cross-modal alignment in the latent prototype space. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive memory systems, we introduce a memory retrieval strategy to extract semantic-level co-occurrence associations across emotion categories. Through this bottom-up hierarchical abstraction process, our model learns affectively informative representations for accurate emotion distribution prediction. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that MPCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mixed emotion recognition, both quantitatively and qualitatively."}

In Bayesian inverse problems, this could be achieved by evaluating the model evidence $p(y \\mid M)$ under different models $M$ that specify the prior and then selecting the one with the highest value. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art approach to solving inverse problems with a data-driven prior; however, directly computing the model evidence with respect to a diffusion prior is intractable. Furthermore, most existing model evidence estimators require either many pointwise evaluations of the unnormalized prior density or an accurate clean prior score. We propose \\method, an estimator of the model evidence of a diffusion prior by integrating over the time-marginals of posterior sampling methods. Our method leverages the large amount of intermediate samples naturally obtained during the reverse diffusion sampling process to obtain an accurate estimation of the model evidence using only a handful of posterior samples (e.g., 20). We also demonstrate how to implement our estimator in tandem with recent diffusion posterior sampling methods. Empirically, our estimator matches the model evidence when it can be computed analytically, and it is able to both select the correct diffusion model prior and diagnose prior misfit under different highly ill-conditioned, non-linear inverse problems, including a real-world black hole imaging problem."}

This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{Equ.} \\mid \\mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This new perspective provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of GenSR. Extensive experiments show that GenSR jointly optimizes predictive accuracy, expression simplicity, and computational efficiency, while remaining robust under noise."}

While convergence properties of such methods are well understood, their finite-iteration stability and generalization behavior remain unclear due to structural bias induced by column-stochastic mixing and asymmetric error propagation. In this work, we develop a unified uniform-stability framework for the Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) algorithm that captures the effect of directed topology. A key technical ingredient is an imbalance-aware consistency bound for Push-Sum, which controls consensus deviation through two quantities: the stationary distribution imbalance parameter $δ$ and the spectral gap $(1-λ)$ governing mixing speed. This decomposition enables us to disentangle statistical effects from topology-induced bias. We establish finite-iteration stability and optimization guarantees for both convex objectives and non-convex objectives satisfying the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition. For convex problems, SGP attains excess generalization error of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{mn}}+\\fracγ{δ(1-λ)}+γ\\right)$ under step-size schedules, and we characterize the corresponding optimal early stopping time that minimizes this bound. For PŁ objectives, we obtain convex-like optimization and generalization rates with dominant dependence proportional to $κ\\!\\left(1+\\frac{1}{δ(1-λ)}\\right)$, revealing a multiplicative coupling between problem conditioning and directed communication topology. Our analysis clarifies when Push-Sum correction is necessary compared with standard decentralized SGD and quantifies how imbalance and mixing jointly shape the best attainable learning performance."}

These fingerprints serve as feature vectors to train ML/DL models for molecular property prediction tasks in the field of computational chemistry, drug discovery, biochemistry, and materials science. Recent research has demonstrated that SMILES can be used to construct molecular graphs where atoms are nodes ($V$) and bonds are edges ($E$). These graphs can subsequently be used to train geometric DL models like GNN. GNN learns the inherent structural relationships within a molecule rather than depending on fixed-size fingerprints. Although GNN are powerful aggregators, their efficacy on smaller datasets and inductive biases across different architectures is less studied. In our present study, we performed a systematic benchmarking of four different GNN architectures across a diverse domain of datasets (physical chemistry, biological, and analytical). Additionally, we have also implemented a hierarchical fusion (GNN+FP) framework for target prediction. We observed that the fusion framework consistently outperforms or matches the performance of standalone GNN (RMSE improvement > $7\\%$) and baseline models. Further, we investigated the representational similarity using centered kernel alignment (CKA) between GNN and fingerprint embeddings and found that they occupy highly independent latent spaces (CKA $\\le0.46$).

A Feature-Based Triggerless Backdoor Attack in Vertical Federated Learning", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CR"], "comment": null, "summary": "As a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm, vertical federated learning (VFL) allows multiple passive parties with distinct features and one active party with labels to collaboratively train a model. Although it is known for the privacy-preserving capabilities, VFL still faces significant privacy and security threats from backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks typically involve an attacker implanting a trigger into the model during the training phase and executing the attack by adding the trigger to the samples during the inference phase. However, in this paper, we find that triggers are not essential for backdoor attacks in VFL. In light of this, we disclose a new backdoor attack pathway in VFL by introducing a feature-based triggerless backdoor attack. This attack operates under a more stringent security assumption, where the attacker is honest-but-curious rather than malicious during the training phase. It comprises three modules: label inference for the targeted backdoor attack, poison generation with amplification and perturbation mechanisms, and backdoor execution to implement the attack. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms three baseline backdoor attacks by 2 to 50 times while minimally impacting the main task. Even in VFL scenarios with 32 passive parties and only one set of auxiliary data, our attack maintains high performance. Moreover, when confronted with distinct defense strategies, our attack remains largely unaffected and exhibits strong robustness. We hope that the disclosure of this triggerless backdoor attack pathway will encourage the community to revisit security threats in VFL scenarios and inspire researchers to develop more robust and practical defense strategies."}

We demonstrate that standard \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" protocols suffer from a systematic Alignment Gap when applied to upper-undergraduate to early graduate level mathematics. To quantify this, we introduce QEDBench, the first large-scale dual-rubric alignment benchmark to systematically measure alignment with human experts on university-level math proofs by contrasting course-specific rubrics against expert common knowledge criteria. By deploying a dual-evaluation matrix (7 judges x 5 solvers) against 1,000+ hours of human evaluation, we reveal that certain frontier evaluators like Claude Opus 4.5, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen 2.5 Max, and Llama 4 Maverick exhibit significant positive bias (up to +0.18, +0.20, +0.30, +0.36 mean score inflation, respectively). Furthermore, we uncover a critical reasoning gap in the discrete domain: while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.91 average human evaluation score), other reasoning models like GPT-5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 see their performance significantly degrade in discrete domains.

Existing LLM self-evaluation methods rely on a model's ability to estimate the correctness of its own outputs, which can improve deployment reliability; however, they depend heavily on language priors and are therefore ill-suited for evaluating vision-conditioned predictions. We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence. VAUQ introduces the Image-Information Score (IS), which captures the reduction in predictive uncertainty attributable to visual input, and an unsupervised core-region masking strategy that amplifies the influence of salient regions. Combining predictive entropy with this core-masked IS yields a training-free scoring function that reliably reflects answer correctness. Comprehensive experiments show that VAUQ consistently outperforms existing self-evaluation methods across multiple datasets."}

This research introduces a transformative framework for generating large-scale urban mobility trajectories, employing a novel application of a transformer-based model pre-trained and fine-tuned through a two-phase process. Initially, trajectory generation is conceptualized as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with a significant reduction in vocabulary space achieved during tokenization. The integration of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) allows for the capture of trajectory-wise reward signals, leveraging historical data to infer individual mobility preferences. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the constructed reward model, effectively addressing the challenges inherent in traditional RL-based autoregressive methods, such as long-term credit assignment and handling of sparse reward environments. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that our framework markedly surpasses existing models in terms of reliability and diversity. Our findings not only advance the field of urban mobility modeling but also provide a robust methodology for simulating urban data, with significant implications for traffic management and urban development planning. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wangjw6/TrajGPT_R."}

However, existing methods face a critical trade-off: conventional functional models are limited by linearity, whereas deep learning approaches lack interpretable region selection for sparse effects. To bridge these gaps, we propose a sparse Bayesian functional deep neural network (sBayFDNN). It learns adaptive functional embeddings through a deep Bayesian architecture to capture complex nonlinear relationships, while a structured prior enables interpretable, region-wise selection of influential domains with quantified uncertainty. Theoretically, we establish rigorous approximation error bounds, posterior consistency, and region selection consistency. These results provide the first theoretical guarantees for a Bayesian deep functional model, ensuring its reliability and statistical rigor. Empirically, comprehensive simulations and real-world studies confirm the effectiveness and superiority of sBayFDNN. Crucially, sBayFDNN excels in recognizing intricate dependencies for accurate predictions and more precisely identifies functionally meaningful regions, capabilities fundamentally beyond existing approaches."}

While AI for Science has witnessed the transformative power of foundation models in disciplines like genomics and meteorology, urban computing remains fragmented due to \"scenario-specific\" models, which are overfitted to specific regions or tasks, hindering their generalizability. To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data. Furthermore, we establish EvalST, the largest-scale urban spatio-temporal benchmark to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrbanFM achieves remarkable zero-shot generalization across unseen cities and tasks, marking a pivotal first step toward large-scale urban spatio-temporal foundation models."}

In this environment, a learner seeks to recover the mean $μ$ of a true distribution $P$ from a collection of sources that are both statistically heterogeneous and potentially malicious. We formalize this challenge through a double corruption landscape: an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of users are entirely adversarial, while the remaining ``good'' users provide data from distributions that are related to $P$, but deviate by a proximity parameter $α$.\n  Unlike existing work on the untrusted batch model, which typically measures this deviation via total variation distance in discrete settings, we address the continuous, high-dimensional regime under two natural variants for deviation: (1) good batches are drawn from distributions with a mean-shift of $\\sqrtα$, or (2) an $α$-fraction of samples within each good batch are adversarially corrupted. In particular, the second model presents significant new challenges: in high dimensions, unlike discrete settings, even a small fraction of sample-level corruption can shift empirical means and covariances arbitrarily.\n  We provide two Sum-of-Squares (SoS) based algorithms to navigate this tiered corruption. Our algorithms achieve the minimax-optimal error rate $O(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon/n} + \\sqrt{d/nN} + \\sqrtα)$, demonstrating that while heterogeneity $α$ represents an inherent statistical difficulty, the influence of adversarial users is suppressed by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{n}$ due to the internal averaging afforded by the batch structure."}

Surrogate models can accelerate hydraulic-structure design, but progress is limited by scarce large, well-documented datasets that jointly capture geometric variation, operating conditions, and functional performance. This study presents WeirNet, a large 3D CFD benchmark dataset for geometric surrogate modeling of PKWs. WeirNet contains 3,794 parametric, feasibility-constrained rectangular and trapezoidal PKW geometries, each scheduled at 19 discharge conditions using a consistent free-surface OpenFOAM workflow, resulting in 71,387 completed simulations that form the benchmark and with complete discharge coefficient labels. The dataset is released as multiple modalities compact parametric descriptors, watertight surface meshes and high-resolution point clouds together with standardized tasks and in-distribution and out-of-distribution splits. Representative surrogate families are benchmarked for discharge coefficient prediction. Tree-based regressors on parametric descriptors achieve the best overall accuracy, while point- and mesh-based models remain competitive and offer parameterization-agnostic inference. All surrogates evaluate in milliseconds per sample, providing orders-of-magnitude speedups over CFD runtimes. Out-of-distribution results identify geometry shift as the dominant failure mode compared to unseen discharge values, and data-efficiency experiments show diminishing returns beyond roughly 60% of the training data. By publicly releasing the dataset together with simulation setups and evaluation pipelines, WeirNet establishes a reproducible framework for data-driven hydraulic modeling and enables faster exploration of PKW designs during the early stages of hydraulic planning."}

However, the complex interplay of multiple uncertainty sources in real environments poses significant challenges for interpretable risk assessment and robust decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose Fuz-RL, a fuzzy measure-guided robust framework for safe RL. Specifically, our framework develops a novel fuzzy Bellman operator for estimating robust value functions using Choquet integrals. Theoretically, we prove that solving the Fuz-RL problem (in Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) form) is equivalent to solving distributionally robust safe RL problems (in robust CMDP form), effectively avoiding min-max optimization. Empirical analyses on safe-control-gym and safety-gymnasium scenarios demonstrate that Fuz-RL effectively integrates with existing safe RL baselines in a model-free manner, significantly improving both safety and control performance under various types of uncertainties in observation, action, and dynamics."}

Push-forward generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders and normalising flows offer a computationally efficient alternative for posterior sampling. However, push-forward models are opaque as they lack the modularity of Bayes Theorem, leading to poor generalisation with respect to changes in the likelihood function. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to GAN architecture design by applying deep unfolding to Langevin MCMC algorithms. This paradigm maps fixed-step iterative algorithms onto modular neural networks, yielding architectures that are both flexible and amenable to interpretation. Crucially, our design allows key model parameters to be specified at inference time, offering robustness to changes in the likelihood parameters. We train these unfolded samplers end-to-end using a supervised regularized Wasserstein GAN framework for posterior sampling. Through extensive Bayesian imaging experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves high sampling accuracy and excellent computational efficiency, while retaining the physics consistency, adaptability and interpretability of classical MCMC strategies."}

Energy Demand Forecasting (EDF) of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) is one of the most critical operations for ensuring efficient energy management and sustainability, since it enables utility providers to anticipate energy/power demand, optimize resource allocation, and implement proactive measures to improve grid reliability. However, accurate EDF is a challenging problem due to external factors, such as the varying user routines, weather conditions, driving behaviors, unknown state of charge, etc. Furthermore, as concerns and restrictions about privacy and sustainability have grown, training data has become increasingly fragmented, resulting in distributed datasets scattered across different data silos and/or edge devices, calling for federated learning solutions. In this paper, we investigate different well-established time series forecasting methodologies to address the EDF problem, from statistical methods (the ARIMA family) to traditional machine learning models (such as XGBoost) and deep neural networks (GRU and LSTM). We provide an overview of these methods through a performance comparison over four real-world EVSE datasets, evaluated under both centralized and federated learning paradigms, focusing on the trade-offs between forecasting fidelity, privacy preservation, and energy overheads. Our experimental results demonstrate, on the one hand, the superiority of gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) over statistical and NN-based models in both prediction accuracy and energy efficiency and, on the other hand, an insight that Federated Learning-enabled models balance these factors, offering a promising direction for decentralized energy demand forecasting."}

Within this framework, we derive a closed-form analysis of adaptability, memorability, and generalization from the perspective of rehearsal scale. Our results uncover several intriguing and counterintuitive findings. First, rehearsal can impair model's adaptability, in sharp contrast to its traditionally recognized benefits. Second, increasing the rehearsal scale does not necessarily improve memory retention. When tasks are similar and noise levels are low, the memory error exhibits a diminishing lower bound. Finally, we validate these insights through numerical simulations and extended analyses on deep neural networks across multiple real-world datasets, revealing statistical patterns of rehearsal mechanisms in continual learning."}

By deriving the optimal parameter update magnitude that minimizes forgetting, we unify two representative update paradigms, frozen training and initialized training, within an optimization framework for constrained parameter updates. Our theoretical results further reveals that sequence tasks with small parameter distances exhibit better generalization and less forgetting under frozen training rather than initialized training. These theoretical insights inspire a novel hybrid parameter update strategy that adaptively adjusts update magnitude based on gradient directions. Experiments on deep neural networks demonstrate that this hybrid approach outperforms standard training strategies, providing new theoretical perspectives and practical inspiration for designing efficient and scalable continual learning algorithms."}

Genuinely solving such tasks requires Dec-POMDP reasoning, where agents use history to infer hidden states and coordinate based on local information. Yet it remains unclear whether popular benchmarks actually demand this reasoning or permit success via simpler strategies. We introduce a diagnostic suite combining statistically grounded performance comparisons and information-theoretic probes to audit the behavioural complexity of baseline policies (IPPO and MAPPO) across 37 scenarios spanning MPE, SMAX, Overcooked, Hanabi, and MaBrax. Our diagnostics reveal that success on these benchmarks rarely requires genuine Dec-POMDP reasoning. Reactive policies match the performance of memory-based agents in over half the scenarios, and emergent coordination frequently relies on brittle, synchronous action coupling rather than robust temporal influence. These findings suggest that some widely used benchmarks may not adequately test core Dec-POMDP assumptions under current training paradigms, potentially leading to over-optimistic assessments of progress. We release our diagnostic tooling to support more rigorous environment design and evaluation in cooperative MARL."}

While RL agents require extensive self-play games to extract useful signals, humans often need only a few games, improving rapidly by repeatedly revisiting states where mistakes occurred. This idea, known as search control, aims to restart from valuable states rather than always from the initial state. In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions. Across 9x9 Go, 10x10 Othello, and 11x11 Hex, RGSC outperforms AlphaZero and Go-Exploit by an average of 77 and 89 Elo, respectively. When training on a well-trained 9x9 Go model, RGSC further improves the win rate against KataGo from 69.3% to 78.2%, while both baselines show no improvement. These results demonstrate that RGSC provides an effective mechanism for search control, improving both efficiency and robustness of AlphaZero training.

We apply transcoder adapters to characterize the differences between Qwen2.5-Math-7B and its reasoning-distilled variant, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. Learned adapters are faithful to the target model's internal computation and next-token predictions. When evaluated on reasoning benchmarks, adapters match the reasoning model's response lengths and typically recover 50-90% of the accuracy gains from reasoning fine-tuning. Adapter features are sparsely activating and interpretable. When examining adapter features, we find that only ~8% have activating examples directly related to reasoning behaviors. We deeply study one such behavior -- the production of hesitation tokens (e.g., \"wait\"). Using attribution graphs, we trace hesitation to only ~2.4% of adapter features (5.6k total) performing one of two functions. These features are necessary and sufficient for producing hesitation tokens; removing them reduces response length, often without affecting accuracy. Overall, our results provide insight into reasoning training and suggest transcoder adapters may be useful for studying fine-tuning more broadly."}

To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest (SAEF), a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is.

In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning (ML) model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks (episodes). Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising $931538$ EEG samples under $1610$ object labels, acquired from $264$ human participants (subjects) performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring.\n  We examine how the semantic abstraction level affects classification performance across multiple learning techniques and architectures, providing a comprehensive analysis. The models tend to improve performance when the classification categories are drawn from higher levels of the hierarchy, suggesting sensitivity to abstraction. Our work highlights abstraction depth as an underexplored dimension of EEG decoding and motivates future research in this direction."}

The performance of these optimization routines is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters (HPs), which are computationally expensive to tune for large-scale models. Maximal update parameterization $(μ$P$)$ is a set of scaling rules which aims to make the optimal HPs independent of the model size, thereby allowing the HPs tuned on a smaller (computationally cheaper) model to be transferred to train a larger, target model. Despite promising results for SGD and Adam, deriving $μ$P for other optimizers is challenging because the underlying tensor programming approach is difficult to grasp. Building on recent work that introduced spectral conditions as an alternative to tensor programs, we propose a novel framework to derive $μ$P for a broader class of optimizers, including AdamW, ADOPT, LAMB, Sophia, Shampoo and Muon. We implement our $μ$P derivations on multiple benchmark models and demonstrate zero-shot learning rate transfer across increasing model width for the above optimizers.

The law of robustness states that overparameterization is necessary for models to interpolate robustly; in particular, robust interpolation requires the learned function to be Lipschitz. Robust generalization asks whether small robust training loss implies small robust test loss. We resolve this problem by explicitly connecting the two for arbitrary data distributions. Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al.\\ (2023) and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al.\\ (2023). For MNIST, we find that the lower-bound Lipschitz constant scales on the order predicted by Wu et al.\\ (2023).

However, existing methods suffer from expensive training cost or rely on global correlation assumptions that often fail in practice to capture how fidelity relationships vary across the input space, leading to poor performance particularly under tight budget constraints. We introduce MAST, a method that blends corrected low-fidelity observations with high-fidelity predictions, trusting high-fidelity near observed samples and relying on corrected low-fidelity elsewhere. MAST achieves this through explicit discrepancy modelling and distance-based weighting with closed-form variance propagation, producing a single heteroscedastic Gaussian process.

Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal). But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training.

We evaluate intra- and inter-node training efficiency across multiple GPU configurations on various datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, exploring the impact of distributed data parallelism on training speed, communication overhead, and overall scalability (strong and weak scaling). By systematically varying software parameters, such as batch size and gradient accumulation, we identify key factors influencing performance of distributed training. The experiments in this study provide a foundational basis for applying DeepSpeed to image-related tasks. Future work will extend these investigations to deepen our understanding of DeepSpeed's limitations and explore strategies for optimizing distributed training pipelines for Vision Transformers."}

Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.\n  We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved."}

We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints. We focus on human motion generation - a domain where kinematic structure, smooth temporal continuity, and interactive use cases (choreography, rehabilitation, HCI) make topology-aware control especially natural - demonstrating controlled divergence and convergence from reference sequences through simple grid-based sampling.

However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction.

Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \\log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces."}

The resources differ in their quality, which may need to be learned. In addition, resources can only be assigned to a subset of tasks that overlaps to varying degrees with the subset of tasks other resources can be assigned to. The objective is to maximize task completion while satisfying soft capacity constraints across all the resources. The scale of the real-world problem poses substantial challenges, since there are over 2000 mediators and a multitude of combinations of geographic locations (87) and case types (12) that each mediator is qualified to work on. Together, these features, unknown quality of new resources, soft capacity constraints, and a high-dimensional state space, make existing scheduling and resource allocation algorithms either inapplicable or inefficient. We formalize the problem in a tractable manner using a quadratic program formulation for assignment and a multi-agent bandit-style framework for learning. We demonstrate the key properties and advantages of our new algorithm, SMaRT (Selecting Mediators that are Right for the Task), compared with baselines on stylized instances of the mediator allocation problem. We then consider its application to real-world data on cases and mediators from the Kenyan judiciary. SMaRT outperforms baselines and allows control over the tradeoff between the strictness of capacity constraints and overall case resolution rates, both in settings where mediator quality is known beforehand and in bandit-like settings where learning is part of the problem definition. On the strength of these results, we plan to run a randomized controlled trial with SMaRT in the judiciary in the near future."}

MOSFETs are integral components of Power Electronic Building Blocks (PEBBs) and experiences the majority of the thermal load. Effective cooling of MOSFETs is therefore essential to prevent overheating and potential burnout. Determining the required velocity for the purpose of effective cooling is of importance but is an ill-posed inverse problem and difficult to solve using traditional methods. MOSFET consists of multiple layers with different thermal conductivities, including aluminum, pyrolytic graphite sheets (PGS), and stainless steel pipes containing flowing water. We propose an algorithm that employs sequential training of the MOSFET layers in PINNs. Mathematically, the sequential training method decouples the optimization of each layer by treating the parameters of other layers as constants during its training phase. This reduces the dimensionality of the optimization landscape, making it easier to find the global minimum for each layer's parameters and avoid poor local minima. Convergence of the PINNs solution to the analytical solution is theoretically analyzed. Finally we show the prediction of our proposed methodology to be in good agreement with experimental results."}

In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that GNNSIC attains comparable or improved Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance to DeepSIC with significantly fewer parameters and training samples."}

While deep learning has advanced DNPS, existing models inadequately enforce the fundamental mass consistency constraint, that a predicted peptide's mass must match the experimental measured precursor mass. Previous DNPS methods often treat this critical information as a simple input feature or use it in post-processing, leading to numerous implausible predictions that do not adhere to this fundamental physical property. To address this limitation, we introduce DiffuNovo, a novel regressor-guided diffusion model for de novo peptide sequencing that provides explicit peptide-level mass control. Our approach integrates the mass constraint at two critical stages: during training, a novel peptide-level mass loss guides model optimization, while at inference, regressor-based guidance from gradient-based updates in the latent space steers the generation to compel the predicted peptide adheres to the mass constraint. Comprehensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuNovo surpasses state-of-the-art methods in DNPS accuracy. Additionally, as the first DNPS model to employ a diffusion model as its core backbone, DiffuNovo leverages the powerful controllability of diffusion architecture and achieves a significant reduction in mass error, thereby producing much more physically plausible peptides. These innovations represent a substantial advancement toward robust and broadly applicable DNPS. The source code is available in the supplementary material."}

Quantifying low-concentration metabolites such as GABA ($γ$-aminobutyric acid) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral overlap. We investigate and validate deep learning for quantifying complex, low-SNR, overlapping signals from MEGA-PRESS spectra, devise a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Y-shaped autoencoder (YAE), and select the best models via Bayesian optimisation on 10,000 simulated spectra from slice-profile-aware MEGA-PRESS simulations. The selected models are trained on 100,000 simulated spectra. We validate their performance on 144 spectra from 112 experimental phantoms containing five metabolites of interest (GABA, Glu, Gln, NAA, Cr) with known ground truth concentrations across solution and gel series acquired at 3 T under varied bandwidths and implementations. These models are further assessed against the widely used LCModel quantification tool. On simulations, both models achieve near-perfect agreement (small MAEs; regression slopes $\\approx 1.00$, $R^2 \\approx 1.00$). On experimental phantom data, errors initially increased substantially. However, modelling variable linewidths in the training data significantly reduced this gap. The best augmented deep learning models achieved a mean MAE for GABA over all phantom spectra of 0.151 (YAE) and 0.160 (FCNN) in max-normalised relative concentrations, outperforming the conventional baseline LCModel (0.220). A sim-to-real gap remains, but physics-informed data augmentation substantially reduced it. Phantom ground truth is needed to judge whether a method will perform reliably on real data."}

Objectives: The study aims to identify multilevel predictors of overweight and obesity among U.S. adolescents and compare the predictive performance, calibration, and subgroup equity of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Data and Methods: We analyze 18,792 children aged 10-17 years from the 2021 National Survey of Children's Health. Overweight/obesity is defined using BMI categories. Predictors included diet, physical activity, sleep, parental stress, socioeconomic conditions, adverse experiences, and neighborhood characteristics. Models include logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, multilayer perceptron, and TabNet. Performance is evaluated using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Brier score. Results: Discrimination range from 0.66 to 0.79. Logistic regression, gradient boosting, and MLP showed the most stable balance of discrimination and calibration. Boosting and deep learning modestly improve recall and F1 score. No model was uniformly superior. Performance disparities across race and poverty groups persist across algorithms. Conclusion: Increased model complexity yields limited gains over logistic regression. Predictors consistently span behavioral, household, and neighborhood domains. Persistent subgroup disparities indicate the need for improved data quality and equity-focused surveillance rather than greater algorithmic complexity."}

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings."}

The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

This paper proposes a zero-overhead online and continual learning framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) neural receivers that directly detect the soft bits of received signals. Unlike conventional fine-tuning methods that rely on dedicated training intervals or full resource grids, our approach leverages existing demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to simultaneously enable signal demodulation and model adaptation. We introduce three pilot designs: fully randomized, hybrid, and additional pilots that flexibly support joint demodulation and learning. To accommodate these pilot designs, we develop two receiver architectures: (i) a parallel design that separates inference and fine-tuning for uninterrupted operation, and (ii) a forward-pass reusing design that reduces computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively tracks both slow and fast channel distribution variations without additional overhead, service interruption, or catastrophic performance degradation under distribution shift."}

In practice, however, predicted treatment effects are rarely interpreted, reported, or audited at the individual level but, instead, are often aggregated to broader subgroups, such as demographic segments, risk strata, or markets. We show that such aggregation can induce systematic bias of the group-level causal effect: even when models for predicting the individual-level conditional average treatment effect (CATE) are correctly specified and trained on data from randomized experiments, aggregating the predicted CATEs up to the group level does not, in general, recover the corresponding group average treatment effect (GATE). We develop a unified statistical framework to detect and mitigate this form of group bias in randomized experiments. We first define group bias as the discrepancy between the model-implied and experimentally identified GATEs, derive an asymptotically normal estimator, and then provide a simple-to-implement statistical test. For mitigation, we propose a shrinkage-based bias-correction, and show that the theoretically optimal and empirically feasible solutions have closed-form expressions. The framework is fully general, imposes minimal assumptions, and only requires computing sample moments. We analyze the economic implications of mitigating detected group bias for profit-maximizing personalized targeting, thereby characterizing when bias correction alters targeting decisions and profits, and the trade-offs involved. Applications to large-scale experimental data at major digital platforms validate our theoretical results and demonstrate empirical performance."}

To address this problem, we propose a novel diffusion-based planning method, termed as Diffusion Modulation via Environment Mechanism Modeling (DMEMM).

Prior works attempt to address this by using model updates, such as loss and bias, from client models to select participants that can improve the global model's accuracy. However, these updates neither accurately represent a client's heterogeneity nor are their selection methods deterministic. We mitigate these limitations by introducing Terraform, a novel client selection methodology that uses gradient updates and a deterministic selection algorithm to select heterogeneous clients for retraining. This bi-pronged approach allows Terraform to achieve up to 47 percent higher accuracy over prior works. We further demonstrate its efficiency through comprehensive ablation studies and training time analyses, providing strong justification for the robustness of Terraform."}

Prior work studies regret minimization under the constraint of Bayesian Incentive-Compatibility in a static stochastic setting with a fixed and common prior shared amongst the agents and the algorithm designer.\n  We show that (weighted) swap regret bounds on their own suffice to cause agents to faithfully follow forecasts in an approximate Bayes Nash equilibrium, even in dynamic environments in which agents have conflicting prior beliefs and the mechanism designer has no knowledge of any agents beliefs. To obtain these bounds, it is necessary to assume that the agents have some degree of uncertainty not just about the rewards, but about their arrival time -- i.e. their relative position in the sequence of agents served by the algorithm. We instantiate our abstract bounds with concrete algorithms for guaranteeing adaptive and weighted regret in bandit settings."}

To address this, we introduce the Physics-Guided Hypergraph Transformer (PhyGHT), a hybrid architecture that combines distance-aware local graph attention with global self-attention to mirror the physical topology of particle showers formed in proton-proton collisions. Crucially, we integrate a Pileup Suppression Gate (PSG), an interpretable, physics-constrained mechanism that explicitly learns to filter soft noise prior to hypergraph aggregation.

Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations.

Several celebrated results in statistical learning theory, such as the VC theorem and Littlestone's characterization of online learnability, establish conditions on the hypothesis class that allow for learning under independent data and adversarial data, respectively. Building upon recent work bridging these extremes, we study sequential decision making under distributional adversaries that can adaptively choose data-generating distributions from a fixed family $U$ and ask when such problems are learnable with sample complexity that behaves like the favorable independent case. We provide a near complete characterization of families $U$ that admit learnability in terms of a notion known as generalized smoothness i.e. a distribution family admits VC-dimension-dependent regret bounds for every finite-VC hypothesis class if and only if it is generalized smooth. Further, we give universal algorithms that achieve low regret under any generalized smooth adversary without explicit knowledge of $U$. Finally, when $U$ is known, we provide refined bounds in terms of a combinatorial parameter, the fragmentation number, that captures how many disjoint regions can carry nontrivial mass under $U$. These results provide a nearly complete understanding of learnability under distributional adversaries. In addition, building upon the surprising connection between online learning and differential privacy, we show that the generalized smoothness also characterizes private learnability under distributional constraints."}

Statistical methods for analyzing high-resolution actigraph data depend on the specific inferential context, but the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) frameworks require that the methods be congruent to transfer learning and amortization. This article devises amortized Bayesian inference for actigraph time sheets. We pursue a Bayesian approach to ensure full propagation of uncertainty and its quantification using a hierarchical dynamic linear model. We build our analysis around actigraph data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches in Los Angeles (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health in the University of California, Los Angeles. Apart from achieving probabilistic imputation of actigraph time sheets, we are also able to statistically learn about the time-varying impact of explanatory variables on the magnitude of acceleration (MAG) for a cohort of subjects."}

Existing methods primarily focus on improving unknown recall, yet overlook interpretability, often leading to known-unknown confusion and reduced prediction reliability. This paper aims to make the entire OWOD framework interpretable, enabling the detector to truly \"knowing the unknown\". To this end, we propose a concept-driven InterPretable OWOD framework(IPOW) by introducing a Concept Decomposition Model (CDM) for OWOD, which explicitly decomposes the coupled RoI features in Faster R-CNN into discriminative, shared, and background concepts. Discriminative concepts identify the most discriminative features to enlarge the distances between known categories, while shared and background concepts, due to their strong generalization ability, can be readily transferred to detect unknown categories. Leveraging the interpretable framework, we identify that known-unknown confusion arises when unknown objects fall into the discriminative space of known classes. To address this, we propose Concept-Guided Rectification (CGR) to further resolve such confusion. Extensive experiments show that IPOW significantly improves unknown recall while mitigating confusion, and provides concept-level interpretability for both known and unknown predictions."}

Unlike classical analyses that treat gradient noise as additive and localized, perturbations to intermediate outputs and gradients cascade through the computational graph, compounding geometrically with the number of operators. We present the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of this setting. Specifically, we characterize how forward and backward perturbations propagate and amplify within a single gradient step, derive convergence guarantees for both general non-convex objectives and functions satisfying the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition, and identify conditions under which perturbations do not deteriorate the asymptotic convergence order. As a byproduct, our analysis furnishes a theoretical explanation for the gradient spiking phenomenon widely observed in deep learning, precisely characterizing the conditions under which training recovers from spikes or diverges. Experiments on logistic regression with convex and non-convex regularization validate our theories, illustrating the predicted spike behavior and the asymmetric sensitivity to forward versus backward perturbations."}

The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a widely used ergonomic risk assessment tool for lifting tasks that relies on six task variables, including horizontal (H) and vertical (V) hand distances; such distances are typically obtained through manual measurement or specialized sensing systems and are difficult to use in real-world environments. We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V. Across pipelines and camera view configurations, pixel-level segmentation reduced estimation error by approximately 20-30% for H and 35-40% for V relative to the detection-only pipeline. These findings support the feasibility of VLM-based pipelines for video-based estimation of RNLE distance parameters."}

However, most existing approaches remain primarily optimized for reconstruction and compression, often yielding tokens that capture local texture rather than object-level semantic structure. Inspired by the incremental and compositional nature of human communication, we introduce COMmunication inspired Tokenization (COMiT), a framework for learning structured discrete visual token sequences. COMiT constructs a latent message within a fixed token budget by iteratively observing localized image crops and recurrently updating its discrete representation. At each step, the model integrates new visual information while refining and reorganizing the existing token sequence. After several encoding iterations, the final message conditions a flow-matching decoder that reconstructs the full image. Both encoding and decoding are implemented within a single transformer model and trained end-to-end using a combination of flow-matching reconstruction and semantic representation alignment losses. Our experiments demonstrate that while semantic alignment provides grounding, attentive sequential tokenization is critical for inducing interpretable, object-centric token structure and substantially improving compositional generalization and relational reasoning over prior methods."}

We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples. SibylSense alternates memory tuning with a rubric-adversarial policy update that produces rubric-satisfying candidate answers, shrinking discriminative gaps and driving the rubric generator to capture new quality dimensions.

Traditional KL divergence tends to be dominated by the next tokens with the highest probabilities, i.e., the teacher's modes, thereby diminishing the influence of less probable yet potentially informative components of the output distribution. We propose a new tail-aware divergence that decouples the contribution of the teacher model's top-K predicted probabilities from that of lower-probability predictions, while maintaining the same computational profile as the KL Divergence. Our decoupled approach reduces the impact of the teacher modes and, consequently, increases the contribution of the tail of the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our modified distillation method yields competitive performance in both pre-training and supervised distillation of decoder models across various datasets. Furthermore, the distillation process is efficient and can be performed with a modest academic budget for large datasets, eliminating the need for industry-scale computing."}

However, scaling beyond 1-WL to 3-WL and higher requires tensor-based operations that scale as O(n^3) or O(n^4), making them computationally prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we start from the Original-DRESS equation (Castrillo, Leon, and Gomez, 2018)--a parameter-free, continuous dynamical system on edges--and show that it distinguishes the prism graph from K_{3,3}, a pair that 1-WL provably cannot separate. We then generalize it to Motif-DRESS, which replaces triangle neighborhoods with arbitrary structural motifs and converges to a unique fixed point under three sufficient conditions, and further to Generalized-DRESS, an abstract template parameterized by the choice of neighborhood operator, aggregation function and norm. Finally, we introduce Delta-DRESS, which runs DRESS on each node-deleted subgraph G\\{v}, connecting the framework to the Kelly-Ulam reconstruction conjecture. Both Motif-DRESS and Delta-DRESS empirically distinguish Strongly Regular Graphs (SRGs)--such as the Rook and Shrikhande graphs--that confound 3-WL.

In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to $C^1$ continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into $M$ modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points. Finally, we demonstrate that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with FCD features, such as optimized function values, parameters, and derivatives, achieved 16.8% faster convergence and 2.5% higher accuracy over a standard CNN."}

Although VLMs have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in common visual question answering and logical reasoning, they still lack the ability to make reasonable decisions in complex real-world environments. We define this ability as spatial logical reasoning, which not only requires understanding the spatial relationships among objects in complex scenes, but also the logical dependencies between steps in multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial Logical Question Answering (SpatiaLQA), a benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial logical reasoning capabilities of VLMs. SpatiaLQA consists of 9,605 question answer pairs derived from 241 real-world indoor scenes. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 mainstream VLMs, and the results show that even the most advanced models still struggle with spatial logical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a method called recursive scene graph assisted reasoning, which leverages visual foundation models to progressively decompose complex scenes into task-relevant scene graphs, thereby enhancing the spatial logical reasoning ability of VLMs, outperforming all previous methods.

As AI decouples cognition from biology, the marginal cost of measurable execution falls to zero, absorbing any labor capturable by metrics--including creative, analytical, and innovative work. The binding constraint on growth is no longer intelligence but human verification bandwidth: the capacity to validate, audit, and underwrite responsibility when execution is abundant. We model the AGI transition as the collision of two racing cost curves: an exponentially decaying Cost to Automate and a biologically bottlenecked Cost to Verify. This structural asymmetry widens a Measurability Gap between what agents can execute and what humans can afford to verify. It also drives a shift from skill-biased to measurability-biased technical change. Rents migrate to verification-grade ground truth, cryptographic provenance, and liability underwriting--the ability to insure outcomes rather than merely generate them. The current human-in-the-loop equilibrium is unstable: eroded from below as apprenticeship collapses (Missing Junior Loop) and from within as experts codify their obsolescence (Codifier's Curse). Unverified deployment becomes privately rational--a Trojan Horse externality. Unmanaged, these forces pull toward a Hollow Economy. Yet by scaling verification alongside agentic capabilities, the forces that threaten collapse become the catalyst for unbounded discovery and experimentation--an Augmented Economy. We derive a practical playbook for individuals, companies, investors, and policymakers. Today's defining challenge is not the race to deploy the most autonomous systems; it is the race to secure the foundations of their oversight.

Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences.

To address these limitations, we introduce a kernelized self-attention mechanism, where a learnable positional kernel operates purely in the position space, disentangled from semantic similarity, and directly modulates attention weights. When applied per attention block, this kernel enables adaptive multi-scale sequential modeling. Experiments on standard next-item prediction benchmarks show that our positional kernel attention consistently improves over strong competing baselines."}

The framework mimics the emotional state of high curiosity and anticipation of reward in which broader brain regions are recruited to enhance cognitive performance. Exploiting scalable architectures where larger models extend smaller ones, our method enables shared weight updates and selective expansion of network capacity during noteworthy training steps. Empirical evaluation on the image classification task demonstrates that, not only does the alternating training scheme efficiently and effectively enhance the base model compared to a traditional scheme, in some cases, the motivational model also surpasses its standalone counterpart despite seeing less data per epoch. This opens the possibility of simultaneously training two models tailored to different deployment constraints with competitive or superior performance while keeping training cost lower than when training the larger model."}

The original algorithm uses linear combinations of variables in a tree structure where depth is constrained to be less than the number of classes -- a limitation that proves too rigid for complex classification problems. Our extensions improve performance in multi-class settings with unequal variance-covariance structures and nonlinear class separations by allowing more splits and more flexible class groupings in the projection pursuit computation. Proposing algorithmic improvements is straightforward; demonstrating their actual utility is not. We therefore develop two visual diagnostic approaches to verify that the enhancements perform as intended. Using high-dimensional visualization techniques, we examine model fits on benchmark datasets to assess whether the algorithm behaves as theorized. An interactive web application enables users to explore the behavior of both the original and enhanced classifiers under controlled scenarios. The enhancements are implemented in the R package PPtreeExt."}

For non-accelerated local methods, the best known worst-case work scales as $\\widetilde{O} ((αρ)^{-1})$, where $α$ is the teleportation parameter and $ρ$ is the $\\ell_1$-regularization parameter. A natural question is whether FISTA can improve the dependence on $α$ from $1/α$ to $1/\\sqrtα$ while preserving the $1/ρ$ locality scaling. The challenge is that acceleration can break locality by transiently activating nodes that are zero at optimality, thereby increasing the cost of gradient evaluations. We analyze FISTA on a slightly over-regularized objective and show that, under a checkable confinement condition, all spurious activations remain inside a boundary set $\\mathcal{B}$. This yields a bound consisting of an accelerated $(ρ\\sqrtα)^{-1}\\log(α/\\varepsilon)$ term plus a boundary overhead $\\sqrt{vol(\\mathcal{B})}/(ρα^{3/2})$. We provide graph-structural conditions that imply such confinement. Experiments on synthetic and real graphs show the resulting speedup and slowdown regimes under the degree-weighted work model."}

One promising application is assisting radiologists in decision-making by the analysis of radiology imaging data such as chest X-rays (CXR) via a visual and natural language question-answering (VQA) interface. When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets. We further formulate and construct a novel instruction-following dataset incorporating longitudinal studies, enabling the development of a prognostic VQA task. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in diagnostic VQA tasks, and more importantly, shows promising potential for prognostic capabilities. These results underscore the value of well-designed, instruction-tuned VLMs in enabling more accurate and clinically meaningful radiological interpretation of longitudinal radiological imaging data."}

However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research."}

Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.\n  This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead."}

We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=σ_k^{2}/(2μ_k)$, with $μ_k{=}\\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $σ_k^2{=}\\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/μ_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\\sum_k C_k \\approx \\mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\\% over MI and 56.2\\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured."}

Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training than prior visual off-policy and on-policy methods. Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation. We evaluate on the SO-101 Task Set, a new suite of eight manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 with heavy domain randomization, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer to a real SO-101 robot. We train policies for 15 minutes on a single RTX 3090 GPU, with most tasks converging in under 6 minutes."}
