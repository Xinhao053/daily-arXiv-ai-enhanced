This result allowed\nMarkowitz to obtain his famous expression for portfolio variance. We show that\nMarkowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for\nportfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation\nof the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the\nsecurities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show\nthis, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his\nportfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his\nsecurities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio\nas with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and\nvariance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities\ndescribe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the\ndependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and\non the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random\nvolumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the\nconsecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation\nfor the portfolio's random returns. The market-based variance of the portfolio\naccounts for the effects of random fluctuations of the volumes of the\nconsecutive trades. The use of Markowitz variance may give significantly higher\nor lower estimates than market-based portfolio variance."}

In this paper, we propose a\nfederated online learning (FOL) method for distributed multi-source streaming\ndata analysis. To account for heterogeneity, a personalized model is\nconstructed for each data source, and a novel ``subgroup\" assumption is\nemployed to capture potential similarities, thereby enhancing model\nperformance. We adopt the penalized renewable estimation method and the\nefficient proximal gradient descent for model training. The proposed method\naligns with both federated and online learning frameworks: raw data are not\nexchanged among sources, ensuring data privacy, and only summary statistics of\nprevious data batches are required for model updates, significantly reducing\nstorage demands. Theoretically, we establish the consistency properties for\nmodel estimation, variable selection, and subgroup structure recovery,\ndemonstrating optimal statistical efficiency.

A\nsurvival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is\nintroduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric\nflow stability.

Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve\nmodel performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average\ntoken-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data\nrandomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on\naverage token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.\nThis improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and\ninference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and\ntraining objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable\nmultilingual LLMs"}

Tanveer"], "title": "Hypergraph Neural Network with State Space Models for Node Classification", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant\nattention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However,\ntraditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,\noften overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for\nlearning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing\nrole-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal\nperformance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively\nintegrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN\nutilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships\nand combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable\nmamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction\nmethods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the\nconnections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's\nrepresentational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution\nlayers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph\nstructures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we\nincorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature\npropagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly\nintroduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nHGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node\nclassification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results\nhighlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by\neffectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information,\nmaking it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning\napplications."}

However, they are\nvulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors\nby modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust\nscience of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning\nmethods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs\nresistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this\npaper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from\ntraining data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more\ntamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable\ndata filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for\nminimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple\n6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial\nresistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M\ntokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training\nbaselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to\nunrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized\ndangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when\nit is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a\nneed for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish\npretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI\nsystems."}

Real-life data, like images, is often\nspatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion\nmodels ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,\nwhich are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new\nperspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into\nconstructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two\ndistributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be\nmutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.\nThen, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial\nphase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local\ndenoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an\ninformation-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on\nconditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a\nreal-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures\nof diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small\nlocal neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are\nonly necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions.

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution.

Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on\nbenchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable\nrelative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into\ndifferent time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work,\nwe present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a\ngating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of\neach time series.

We propose a theoretical\nHeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure\nlong-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that\nwhen client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart\nsubset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively\ncompared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,\nstep-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update\nspeed, and data variety.

This thesis investigates how\nuncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,\nfocusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is\nlow.\n  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty\nsignals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find\nthat while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains\nrobust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty\ntrade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective\nclassification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --\nidentifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions\ncan close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking\nerrors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering.

However, bridging these theoretical insights with\npractical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we\nexplore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for\noffline RL algorithms.\n  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function\nrepresentation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation\nconditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage\nassumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine\ncounterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically\nlarge amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all\nalgorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to\nmitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for\noffline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs,\nbut they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to\nsearch for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied."}

Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive\ncomputational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous\nmodel aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose\nFed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across\nmobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model\narchitectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering\nserver-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform\nlightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen\npre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations.\nThe server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side\nbackpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model\nheterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise\nfeature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for\ncollaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while\nachieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in\ncomputation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster\nconvergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical\nLLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices."}

However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they\noffer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when\ntasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow\nmulti-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise\nrequire deeper architectures."}

Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform\nto the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data\nstill exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To\naddress this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free\nDiffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training\noverhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly\nenhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different\ndistributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more\ngenerated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while\nmaintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG\noutperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to\ngenerate new data.

Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on\ndemand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of\nboth worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series\nforecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series\nForecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient\nretrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF.\nSpecifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB)\nfor scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a\nMulti-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and\ncoarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation\nCoherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM\nbased and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM\nbased and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and\n87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and\ninference time."}

Recent single-stage\nmethods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled\nmechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we\nreframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \\textbf{implicit\nrewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary\nreward signals. We introduce \\textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel\nsingle-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,\npath-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is\na \\textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL\nbalance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize\nlong-term task performance.

In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank\nAdaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number\nof additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block\nmatrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along\nthe columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\\dots,A_b]$ and\n$B=[B_1,\\dots,B_b]^\\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the\nconcatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\\in[b]$.

Here, we\nintroduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that\nintegrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning\ninto a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in\neducational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and\nactively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime\nevaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring\nadditional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade\nlarge-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design\ncombinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets\nof small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting\nthe average cycle life under unknown device variability.

Existing\nsolutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct\nspatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose\nUniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing\ntwo challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for\neffective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility\npatterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location\ndual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding\nand a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling.

Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities\ndemonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By\nenabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it\nsignificantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\\%.

However, modeling this progression\nremains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained\nthrough irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of\npathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where\ntraditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms\ndominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert\nweighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to\nproperly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,\nconstructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.\nModel-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural\ndiffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and\ntime, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also\nintroduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond\nstandard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these\ncomponents across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how\nstage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The\nstage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,\nsuggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,\nwhile other unknown physical processes become dominant later on."}

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel \"unlearn-then-learn\"\nstrategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting\nand Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach\nis powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets\nthe specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.\nThrough a rigorous experimental methodology on\nmicrosoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically\ninformed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the\nnew, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original\nconflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits\nunprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed\nas low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted\ninterpretability-guided intervention.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,\nwe further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,\nfocusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating\nhow effective in-context representations emerge during training.

This study is the first to reveal that\nstrategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring\nmathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of\nstylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we\nformalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,\nReciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical\nresponses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads\nLLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on\naverage, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,\nincreasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.\nFurther analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques\namplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible.

These\nmisleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations\ninduced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability\nunder distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method\nnamed Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing\nnegative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,\nCNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus\nreduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal\nregularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental\nconfounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives\nthat promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

The Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse\nactivation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The\npresence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe\ndegradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,\nsignificantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,\nefficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to\nbalance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an\nefficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)\nand CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian\nmatrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and\nweights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers\nwhile ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we\ndesign an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,\ncombined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment\nand scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory\nfootprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series\nand Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of\nthe low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while\nGPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is\nsignificantly improved."}

We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how\nit is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the\nfactorization $\\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion\nof kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property\nto hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth\nand show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an\nintrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the\ninitialization, when $\\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting.

However, in many\napplications, the rewards are indeed parsimonious, and some prior information\nis available. We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly\nconstant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a\nlinear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that\nthe reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a\nsparsification problem subject to linear constraints. Moreover, we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm that solves this sparsification problem exactly.\nThen, we show that identifying rewards representable with the minimum number of\nfeatures can be recast as a rank minimization problem subject to linear\nconstraints, for which convex relaxations of rank can be invoked. In both\ncases, these observations lead to efficient optimization-based reward\nidentification algorithms. Several examples are given to demonstrate the\naccuracy of the recovered rewards as well as their generalizability."}

Early and accurate\nprediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,\nprotect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present\nDeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning\noccurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they\noften struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty\nof lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar\nreflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather\nPrediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly\nsensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight\nleverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud\nproperties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder\narchitecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically\ncaptures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel\nHazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of\nlightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling\nthe model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments\nshow that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over\nstate-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning\nprediction."}

In\nthis work, we propose the deep Onsager operator learning (DOOL) method, a novel\nunsupervised framework for solving dissipative equations. Rooted in the Onsager\nvariational principle (OVP), DOOL trains a deep operator network by directly\nminimizing the OVP-defined Rayleighian functional, requiring no labeled data,\nand then proceeds in time explicitly through conservation/change laws for the\nsolution. Another key innovation here lies in the spatiotemporal decoupling\nstrategy: the operator's trunk network processes spatial coordinates\nexclusively, thereby enhancing training efficiency, while integrated external\ntime stepping enables temporal extrapolation. Numerical experiments on typical\ndissipative equations validate the effectiveness of the DOOL method, and\nsystematic comparisons with supervised DeepONet and MIONet demonstrate its\nenhanced performance. Extensions are made to cover the second-order wave models\nwith dissipation that do not directly follow OVP."}

We formalize this dynamic by introducing\nthe Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)\nframework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a\nStackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features\nto benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize\nits Bellman error.

By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality.

In this work, we investigate\nthis phenomenon of \\emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical\nsystems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our\nperturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal\nlearning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target\ndensity only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.\nFurther, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the\nsupport? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive\ninfinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the\nboundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient\ncondition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.\nMoreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for\nrobust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the\ntangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation\nanalysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements\nand extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative\nmodels from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty\nquantification points of view.

The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We\nsummarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)\nTheoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among\nmethods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,\nclarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,\nrigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles.

Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such\nmodels are not available to the research community.\n  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx\nresponds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving\nthe base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It\nprovides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,\nevaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in\nlanguage model safety."}

While\ncollecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and\nscalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle\nwith the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In\nthis paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first\nderive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a\nkey Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference\nconflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it\nto formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our\nprinciple advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by\nthe most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality\nof this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the\nselection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical\nmethods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our\nPD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying\nconflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%\nrelative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a\nstronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting\ntraining efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference\nannotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained\npreference signals."}

NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,\nwhich are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and\nnewly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding\nmeteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make\nspatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To\nhandle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,\nstructure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural\ninformation loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To\nsolve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node\ndegrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and\nobservations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using\nreal-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia.

In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes\nincentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their\nprivacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling\nthe magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being\ndesigned from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves\napproximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)\nanalysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while\nmaintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA)\nbaselines and methods that account for social externalities."}

Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies\nfocus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic\nmodality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data\npatterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent\nperiodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the\nsemantic space to enhance the token embedding.

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal.

To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped\nMixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the\npre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows\nin this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and\nintroduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by\nthe increasing routing complexity.

This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO\napproaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the\nnumber of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering\ndirect optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages.

Data-driven\nTSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine\nlearning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state\nestimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more\naccurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be\nviewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested\ntraffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the\nfirst time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of\nphysics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an\noperator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep\nneural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the\noriginal PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the\nacceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the\nintroduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO\nmechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of\ntraffic flow model parameters.

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction. We show that current label error\ndetection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover\nhundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes\nfrom scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true\nerrors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This\nhighlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released\nbenchmark."}

This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model.

Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution.

The sensing stage\nperforms logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and\nattention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs\nwith a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded\nnumber of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink\ndesign as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and\nsignal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase\nshifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an\naugmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide\nprovable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local\ncurvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO)\nin a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP)\nsurrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound\n(UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of\nthe implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show\nhigher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial\nattacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of\neavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a\npractical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI\navailability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through\njoint learning."}

However, existing methods compromise text quality,\nrequire white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations\nexclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a\ngeneral framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized\nmessages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without\naltering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on\ndeterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose\nfeature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally\ngeneralizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through\nsampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees\nrelating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any\nsuitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection\naccuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's\nconsistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection\naccuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that\nworks out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content\nattribution."}
