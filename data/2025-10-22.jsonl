The\nproblem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price\ndrops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional\ncontinuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized\nIntegral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in\na number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial\ndifferential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation\nof the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by\nconsidering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and\nproportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as\nan integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the\nearly exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the\ndividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard\nnumerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which\ncan struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy\nor performance.

These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in\nlinear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover\nintrinsic relationships.

To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC\n(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model\ncombining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying\ndiscriminator.

While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features).

To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional\nGradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the\nhyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule\noutperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search\nand, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box\nmeta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for\nresearchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on\nhow to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in\noptimization."}

This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate\nshallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation\ndepths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an\neffective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based\non our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header\ntokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens\npossess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens\nmid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals\nat any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,\nGemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety\nperformance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It\nsecures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill\nattacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces\nthe average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,\nAutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving\nutility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this\nresilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning\n(benign or adversarial)."}

A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge\nstored in model parameters.

To mitigate this, we\npropose fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating\nSpectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization\n(Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Our proposed fusion of\ntraditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and\nfairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across\naccent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of\nmacro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of\n58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and\n7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with\ncross-entropy loss."}

To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we\nadopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,\ngenerates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with\ngenerative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion\nmodel, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields.

To\naddress this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds\nexplicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three\nstages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept\nrepresentations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a\ndictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects\nactivating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical\nreasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order\nstructures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on\nmulti-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept\ncues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),\nand context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales\nrobustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and\ncontext-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones.

Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and\nChinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places\nmore correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error."}

Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest.

OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future\ntokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens.

Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task.

This paper presents theoretical results for\noverparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability.\nFirst, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls,\nwe derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension.\nSecond, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly\nprobability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of\nbounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the\nsphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder\nto \"shatter\" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons,\ngradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns\nand thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that\nis easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent\nfavors memorization.

While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations.

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning.

A key\nadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of\ndata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative\nSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement\napplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach\nprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have\nmore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener\nwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a\ncorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by\ncarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically\naligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed\nUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.\nMoreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score\nMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic\nlatency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped\nwith a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency\nfrom 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance.
