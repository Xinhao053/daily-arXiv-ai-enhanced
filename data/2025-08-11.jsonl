SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response\npairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively\ncurating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated\nranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a\nplug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes\nacross diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as\ndecreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a\nrange of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in\ndistilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up\nto 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a\nplug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying\nKD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are\npivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a\nprincipled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of\ndata-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the\ncapability and efficiency of compressed LLMs."}

Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we\nfine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or\nmultilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter\nacross 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific\ndiscourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior.

Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict\nerroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel\nenvironmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies\nin quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data\ndistribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution\n(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions\nregarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a\nmechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model\nthat scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.\nWe update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to\nminimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the\nsource distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',\nor ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor\ndatasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an\naverage of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

In this case, the FI often tends to be\ndistributed among all features which are in correlation with the\nresponse-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features\nare in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly\ncorrelated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a\ndistinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local\nsample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML\nalgorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the\ntraining data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in\ncausal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting\nscheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This\nreduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature\nis evaluated and compared to others. Moreover, losaw comes with a natural\ntuning parameter, the minimum effective sample size of the weighted population,\nwhich corresponds to an interpretation-prediction-tradeoff, analog to a\nbias-variance-tradeoff as for classical ML tuning parameters. We demonstrate\nhow losaw can be integrated within decision tree-based ML methods and within\nmini-batch training of neural networks. We investigate losaw for random forest\nand convolutional neural networks in a simulation study on settings showing\ndiverse correlation patterns. We found that losaw improves FI consistently.\nMoreover, it often improves prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution, while\nmaintaining a similar accuracy for in-distribution test data."}

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting.
