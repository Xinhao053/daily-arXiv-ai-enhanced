To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors.

To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These\nfindings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and\nmoral beliefs."}

Under the setting of online convex optimization, several\nalgorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.\nHowever, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only\nhandle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,\nwhich hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,\nwhich automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially\nconcave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary\nor changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual\nadaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and\naggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a\nsecond-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further\nincorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing\nenvironments.

Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able\nto minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions\nsimultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.\nMoreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,\nand develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of\ncomposite functions."}

Hyperparameter tuning was also\napplied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling\ntechniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception\nwas SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models.\nHowever, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the\nmodels, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The\nDecision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy\namong machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and\nSciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These\nfindings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model\nperformance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted\ndiagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of\ndifferent model architectures and data balancing methods."}
