Numerous studies have\nintroduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and\ntraining algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy\ngradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community\nfor being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However,\nrecent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results\nand underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of\ncryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly\nused state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical\ninformation about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper\nexplores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used\nnormalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and\ncryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing\ndata before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the\nstate normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance."}

However, these\napproaches often fail to ensure a balanced risk structure across assets,\nleading to concentration in a few securities. In this paper, we introduce novel\nrisk measures grounded in the equal-correlation portfolio strategy, aiming to\nconstruct portfolios where each asset maintains an equal correlation with the\noverall portfolio return. We formulate a mathematical optimization framework\nthat explicitly controls portfolio-wide correlation while preserving desirable\nrisk-return trade-offs. The proposed models are empirically validated using\nhistorical stock market data. Our findings show that portfolios constructed via\nthis approach demonstrate superior risk diversification and more stable returns\nunder diverse market conditions. This methodology offers a compelling\nalternative to conventional diversification techniques and holds practical\nrelevance for institutional investors, asset managers, and quantitative trading\nstrategies."}

In this paper, we\nreveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear\nin completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting\ngradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be\nessential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded\ncompletions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward\nunlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading\nlearning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective\npolicy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative\nTrajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens\nappearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,\nprotects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To\nfurther prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy\nexceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence\nregularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,\nwhile still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,\nvalidated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks."}

While effective in low-dimensional settings,\nBO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large\nnumber of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP\nmodels.

However, these methods typically rely on estimating model\nuncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally\nintensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these\nlimitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox\noptimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty\nestimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for\nexploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region\nto ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization\nproblems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four\nstate-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

In these domains,\nfairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a\ncommon challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade\nAUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional\nOptimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework\nthat strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups\nusing optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable\nproportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged\ngroup. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between\nreducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,\nwe extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions\nto concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,\npublic, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms\nexisting post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,\noften achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive\ngains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of\nFairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment."}

While effective in low-dimensional settings,\nBO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large\nnumber of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP\nmodels. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can\nmodel complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO\napproaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model\nuncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally\nintensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these\nlimitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox\noptimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty\nestimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for\nexploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region\nto ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization\nproblems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four\nstate-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

This paper\nproposed a Generative Flexible Latent Structure Regression (GFLSR) model\nstructure to address this problem. Moreover, we show that most linear\ncontinuous latent variable methods can be represented under the proposed\nframework. The recursive structure allows potential model inference and\nresidual analysis. Then, the traditional Partial Least Squares (PLS) is\nfocused; we show that the PLS can be specialised in the proposed model\nstructure, named Generative-PLS. With a model structure, we analyse the\nconvergence of the parameters and the latent variables. Under additional\ndistribution assumptions, we show that the proposed model structure can lead to\nmodel inference without solving the probabilistic model.

Then, a fully connected neural network is\nused to map $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_h}$, of\nthe PDE solution $h(\\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct\n$h(\\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its\nthree components independently.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for\npersonalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous\neffects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support\ndecision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our\napproach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two\ncontrol modalities: \\textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting\ninterventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \\textit{switching control} for\nlonger-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a\nconstrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state\nfeatures, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource\nconstraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,\nincluding insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world\ntherapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work\nestablishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.\nWe provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical\nimprovements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level\nviolations from 22.4\\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\\%."}

The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

We also survey ecosystem and community support,\nincluding library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,\nPyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader\ntooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language\nprocessing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is\nused in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in\ndeep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,\nimproving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler\noptimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while\nboth frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they\nexhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored\nin research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -\nunderstanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the\nappropriate tool.

Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research\ntask remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive\nproblems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal\ncharacterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to\nevaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature\nof deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but\nrather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,\nbroad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we\ndefine DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims\nuncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level\nreport generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging\nbenchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,\ndatasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events\n(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1\nscore ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model\nperforms the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55.

By conditioning the\nmodel on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and\ncontextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can\nbetter support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the\nreliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by\nclinical professionals.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training.

In this work, we\nintroduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image\nclassification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to\nfocus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called\nweight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine\nunlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the\nperformance gap with \"exact\" unlearning.

However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,\nand real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address\nthis, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at\ntraining customer service agents to respond using well-defined support\nstrategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,\ndefining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality\ninteractions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of\n1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect\ndeliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a\nrole-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using\nLLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training\ndataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS\nsignificantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned\nresponses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem\nresolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin."}

Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper\ninvestigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary\nideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating\nresearch proposals and systematically compare configurations including group\nsize, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in\ninterdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a\ncomprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across\ndimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our\nresults show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary\nbaselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into\nmore integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive\ndiversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable\nprerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass\neven a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for\ndesigning collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team\nstructure influences creative outcomes."}

This paper presents a\nsystematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to\nwhich stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,\nand evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case\nstudy with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),\nidentifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our\nfindings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs\nof communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete\nrecommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech\nresearch."}

Existing PFL\nmethods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data\nheterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders\nconvergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in\nthe long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently\nsensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the\nresearch gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized\nFederated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)\nsolutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend\nof self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,\nwe further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP\nscheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%\nin accuracy."}

However,\ntraffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy\nconstraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for\ntraffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients.

Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential\nfor efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training\nstrategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one\ndimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The\ntwo-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within\nthe experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from\nsteel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based\nquality control in industrial applications."}

While\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance\nrecently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision\nfrom sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor\ngeneralization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution\nto address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a\npairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level\ninformation. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the\ntransferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to\neffectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the\ndiversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate\nexperts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse\ndownstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient\ntuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets\nwith minimal computational overhead.

To explore the\nopportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a\nMolecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how\nLLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in\ntraining. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach,\nobtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein\nsystems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the\nprediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1\ncan learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes\nof proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics\nand kinetics."}

Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized\ncuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature\nextraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values\nfor explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and\naggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was\nstratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived\nfeatures were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing\nrhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the\nhighest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming\nbaseline models.

In this\npaper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment\neffectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level\nvision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to\ndifferentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical\nstructure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling\nmethod to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging\nVQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This\nprocess amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in\nabnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of\nabnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures\nthe diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate\nalignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nchest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,\nMedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across\nmultiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning\ncapabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/ViSD-Boost."}

The method\nachieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with\nsharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average\nDice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues.\nFurthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed\nneurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the\nmaturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized\ndevelopmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance,\nsupporting both research and clinical applications.

Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that\nrepresent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac\nmorphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be\nused to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.\nelectrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though\ndeep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great\nadvancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain\nshift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data\ndistributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known\nat training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that\nutilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.\nFurther, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at\ntest-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques\nto greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart\nsegmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the\nbest performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best\nperformance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With\n93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR\ndata, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate\nsemantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be\ngenerated."}

In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to\nprevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac\ndigital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,\nhowever, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred\ntissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic\nresonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading\nRefinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium\nas well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage\nCNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a\nprediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction\nwith the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial\nscar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during\ntraining, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the\ndiversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold\nensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm\nASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more\nchallenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through\nLA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac\ndigital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation\ntherapy to treat AF."}

A Comprehensive Analysis on Multimodal Representations for Recommendation", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "comment": "Accepted as Full Research Papers at CIKM 2025", "summary": "Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by\nintegrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While\neffective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal\nunderstanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of\nmultimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the\nrepresentations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via\nstructured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of\nsemantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling\nfoundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in\nrecommendation tasks."}

The method was benchmarked against non\nprobabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic\nnetwork with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed\non synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in\nvivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed\nusing calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous\nRanked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper\npredictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight\noverconfidence was observed in D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV)\nindicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian\nmodel.

Although most existing methods address only one of\nthese challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach\nthat resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework\nthrough a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This\nframework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into\nbeneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The\nfundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the\ntrue sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to\nidentify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's\nbehavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious\ncorrelations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,\nARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to\nensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious\ncorrelations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso\nmight have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus\nspurious correlations create a divisible separation. By setting an appropriate\nthreshold, our framework can effectively distinguish between these two\nphenomena, thereby maximizing the inclusion of informative variables while\nminimizing the introduction of detrimental ones.

To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting.
