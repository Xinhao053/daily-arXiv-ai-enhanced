Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This\nadaptivity yields up to 20\\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without\nincreasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test\ntime offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.\nSelf-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative\nreasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures."}

Our results indicate that\nLLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive\nUtilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to\naveraging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group\nstructure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.\nFurthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item\nsimilarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our\nfindings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as\nstandard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were\ndependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential\ninefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.\nAdditionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency\nand explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS."}

Results indicate a significant positive correlation\nbetween the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both\ndepressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior\nfindings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage\nfrequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the\nclients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the\nframework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and\nindividualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to\npsycho-counseling conversations.

This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge.

To eliminate temporal\nambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units\n(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal\nanchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture\ntemporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event\ngraph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting\nefficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent\ngeneration, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that\nretrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time\nChain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation.

We achieve this through two key\ninnovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector\nposition prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging\nthe efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable\ntraining performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational\ndemands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training\ncharacteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed\nand memory efficiency.

In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,\ngenerating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named\nQuery Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the\ncentral task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method\nto increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is\nstill a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and\ntrustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any\nknowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,\ns.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is\npossible."}

The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature.

We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph.

To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,\nand robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly\navailable diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -\n2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous\nglucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected\nfrom 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with\ntype 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support\nresearchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes\ndatasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with\ndata selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood\nglucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through\nthis case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction\nacross all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML\ncollection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different\nprediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets.

For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings."}

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels.
