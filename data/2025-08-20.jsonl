We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with\nBackward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and\nprove that it achieves a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$\nepisodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the\nfact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a\nsecond algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning\n(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,\nuser scaling, with a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate\nour theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical\neffectiveness of both algorithms under various settings."}

Despite its\ntheoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied\nwork, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of\npractical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically\ncomparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal\nscenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including\nsymbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a\ncommon evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a\nrecently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to\ncounterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency\n(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving\nboth discrete and continuous data-generating processes.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This\ndemonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent\nsupervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning\ncapabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient\ndeployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without\nrequiring extensive infrastructure upgrades."}

It is a new method from the general topology\nperspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets\nare assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using\nopen sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types\nand its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate\nthe inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,\nin which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.\nThose components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer\nsequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be\nwell represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree).

Existing ITS solutions\noften employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust\nsystem defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches\nrely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis\nfor newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's\nresponsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager\nintroduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine\nlearning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts\nand assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a\nsystem, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to\nestimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive\ndefense capabilities.\n  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a\nlimitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This\nextended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse\nthreat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time\nexploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence\nbase, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with\nHAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to\naddress emerging threats. This paper details the scraper's integration into the\narchitecture, its role in providing additional information on new threats, and\nthe effects on HAL 9000's management."}

Published at ECAI 2025 in a version without the\n  Appendix", "summary": "Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is\nessential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines\ncommon methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are\ncore elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve\nmapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,\nknown as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these\nsemantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain\nthe corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that\nprediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based\ninterpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,\nconcluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic\nupper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word\nembeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on\nprediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better\ncaptured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings\nprimarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than\nindicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named\nSmooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data\nto enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon\nflow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate\ninfinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank\nassumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations,\nand guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical\nand flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are\nnot applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the\nadvantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational\nefficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the\nMIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database.

Conformal selection\noffers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection\nwith uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its\napplication to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses\nchallenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously\nselected candidates, which is incompatible with applications requiring\nirreversible selection decisions. This limitation is particularly evident in\nresource-intensive sequential processes, such as drug discovery, where\nadvancing a compound to subsequent stages renders reversal impractical. To\naddress this issue, we extend conformal selection to an online Accept-to-Reject\nChanges (ARC) procedure: non-selected data points can be reconsidered for\nselection later, and once a candidate is selected, the decision is\nirreversible. Specifically, we propose a novel conformal selection method,\nOnline Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (dubbed OCS-ARC),\nwhich incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure into the candidate\nselection process. We provide theoretical guarantees that OCS-ARC controls the\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) at or below the nominal level at any timestep under\nboth i.i.d. and exchangeable data assumptions. Additionally, we theoretically\nshow that our approach naturally extends to multivariate response settings.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that\nOCS-ARC significantly improves selection power over the baseline while\nmaintaining valid FDR control across all examined timesteps."}
