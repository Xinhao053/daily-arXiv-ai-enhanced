A model is well calibrated when its predicted probabilities correspond to observed event frequencies. Despite the need for multicategory recalibration methods, existing methods are limited to (i) comparing calibration between two or more models rather than directly assessing the calibration of a single model, (ii) requiring under-the-hood model access, e.g., accessing logit-scale predictions within the layers of a neural network, and (iii) providing output which is difficult for human analysts to understand. To overcome (i)-(iii), we propose Multicategory Linear Log Odds (MCLLO) recalibration, which (i) includes a likelihood ratio hypothesis test to assess calibration, (ii) does not require under-the-hood access to models and is thus applicable on a wide range of classification problems, and (iii) can be easily interpreted. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCLLO method through simulations and three real-world case studies involving image classification via convolutional neural network, obesity analysis via random forest, and ecology via regression modeling. We compare MCLLO to four comparator recalibration techniques utilizing both our hypothesis test and the existing calibration metric Expected Calibration Error to show that our method works well alone and in concert with other methods."}

Focusing on Apple Inc. (AAPL), we construct a comprehensive intraday dataset that combines volatility normalized returns with transformer-based emotion features extracted from Twitter messages. Overreactions are defined as extreme return realizations relative to contemporaneous volatility and transaction costs and are modeled as a three-class prediction problem. We evaluate the performance of several nonlinear classifiers, including XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Bidirectional LSTMs, across multiple intraday frequencies (1, 5, 10, and 15 minute data). Model outputs are translated into trading strategies and assessed using risk-adjusted performance measures and formal statistical tests. The results show that machine learning models significantly outperform benchmark overreaction rules at ultra short horizons, while classical behavioral momentum effects dominate at intermediate frequencies, particularly around 10 minutes. Explainability analysis based on SHAP reveals that volatility and negative emotions, especially fear and sadness, play a central role in driving predicted overreactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate that emotion-driven overreactions contain a predictable structure that can be exploited by machine learning models, offering new insights into the behavioral origins of intraday momentum and the interaction between sentiment, volatility, and algorithmic trading."}

Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

Includes a dataset-free benchmark with full metric reporting", "summary": "Multi-agent language systems can exhibit a failure mode where a shared dominant context progressively absorbs individual semantics, yielding near-uniform behavior across agents. We study this effect under the name Asymptotic Semantic Collapse in Hierarchical Optimization. In a closed linguistic setting with a Dominant Anchor Node whose semantic state has effectively infinite inertia, we show that repeated interactions with Peripheral Agent Nodes drive an asymptotic alignment that minimizes a global loss. We model semantic states as points on a Riemannian manifold and analyze the induced projection dynamics. Two consequences follow. First, the limiting semantic configuration is insensitive to the optimization history: both smooth gradient-style updates and stochastic noisy updates converge to the same topological endpoint, establishing path independence at convergence. Second, the degree of context dependence controls information content: moving from atomic (independent) representations to fully entangled (context-bound) representations forces the node entropy, interpreted as available degrees of freedom, to vanish in the limit. The theory connects information-theoretic quantities with differential-geometric structure and suggests an interpretation as an immutable consensus rule that constrains agents to a shared semantic grammar. A lightweight dataset-free benchmark on an RWKV-7 13B GGUF checkpoint complements the analysis, reporting zero hash collisions, mean compliance of 0.50 under greedy decoding and 0.531 under stochastic decoding, and final Jaccard-to-anchor similarity values of 0.295 and 0.224, respectively."}

For example, Wasserstein VI (WVI) and black-box VI (BBVI) perform gradient descent in measure space (Bures-Wasserstein space) and parameter space, respectively. Previously, for the Gaussian variational family, convergence guarantees for WVI have shown superiority over existing results for black-box VI with the reparametrization gradient, suggesting the measure space approach might provide some unique benefits. In this work, however, we close this gap by obtaining identical state-of-the-art iteration complexity guarantees for both. In particular, we identify that WVI's superiority stems from the specific gradient estimator it uses, which BBVI can also leverage with minor modifications. The estimator in question is usually associated with Price's theorem and utilizes second-order information (Hessians) of the target log-density. We will refer to this as Price's gradient. On the flip side, WVI can be made more widely applicable by using the reparametrization gradient, which requires only gradients of the log-density. We empirically demonstrate that the use of Price's gradient is the major source of performance improvement."}

MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments on five benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to a 12.13% improvement on the APAVA dataset, while using only 33% of the memory and 20% of the inference time compared to the previous state of the art.

Can we train an LLM to generate high-quality synthetic text without eyes-on access to individual private examples? In this work, we introduce Differentially Private Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (DP-RFT), an online reinforcement learning algorithm for synthetic data generation with LLMs. DP-RFT leverages DP-protected nearest-neighbor votes from an eyes-off private corpus as a reward signal for on-policy synthetic samples generated by an LLM. The LLM iteratively learns to generate synthetic data to maximize the expected DP votes through Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We evaluate DP-RFT for long-form and domain-specific synthetic data generation, such as news articles, meeting transcripts, and medical article abstracts. Our experiments show that DP-RFT closes the gap between private evolution and DP finetuning methods in terms of the fidelity and downstream utility of the generated synthetic data, while respecting the private data boundary."}

We study this effect under the name Asymptotic Semantic Collapse in Hierarchical Optimization. In a closed linguistic setting with a Dominant Anchor Node whose semantic state has effectively infinite inertia, we show that repeated interactions with Peripheral Agent Nodes drive an asymptotic alignment that minimizes a global loss. We model semantic states as points on a Riemannian manifold and analyze the induced projection dynamics. Two consequences follow. First, the limiting semantic configuration is insensitive to the optimization history: both smooth gradient-style updates and stochastic noisy updates converge to the same topological endpoint, establishing path independence at convergence. Second, the degree of context dependence controls information content: moving from atomic (independent) representations to fully entangled (context-bound) representations forces the node entropy, interpreted as available degrees of freedom, to vanish in the limit. The theory connects information-theoretic quantities with differential-geometric structure and suggests an interpretation as an immutable consensus rule that constrains agents to a shared semantic grammar. A lightweight dataset-free benchmark on an RWKV-7 13B GGUF checkpoint complements the analysis, reporting zero hash collisions, mean compliance of 0.50 under greedy decoding and 0.531 under stochastic decoding, and final Jaccard-to-anchor similarity values of 0.295 and 0.224, respectively."}

Among recent advances in deep learning, evolutionary neural networks have been developed to successively capture the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs via parameter evolution.

However, strong-form evolutionary approaches can yield ill-conditioned linear systems due to pointwise residual discretization, and their computational cost scales unfavorably with the number of training samples. To address these limitations, we propose a weak-form evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the scalable and accurate prediction of PDE solutions. We decouple the linear system size from the number of training samples through the weak formulation, leading to improved scalability compared to strong-form approaches. We also rigorously enforce boundary conditions by constructing the trial space with boundary-constrained KANs to satisfy Dirichlet and periodic conditions, and by incorporating derivative boundary conditions directly into the weak formulation for Neumann conditions. In conclusion, the proposed weak-form evolutionary KAN framework provides a stable and scalable approach for PDEs and contributes to scientific machine learning with potential relevance to future engineering applications."}

In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings. By rigorously characterizing the complex interplay among model scale, dataset size, and quantization error, our work provides a principled theoretical basis for optimizing training protocols under practical hardware constraints."}

Claim verification, a.k.a. fact-checking, systems can help identify potential misinformation. However, their efficacy is limited by the knowledge sources that they rely on. Most automated claim verification systems depend on a single knowledge source and utilize the supporting evidence from that source; they ignore the disagreement of their source with others. This limits their knowledge coverage and transparency. To address these limitations, we present a novel system for open-domain claim verification (ODCV) that leverages large language models (LLMs), multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis. Our approach introduces a novel retrieval strategy that collects evidence for both the original and the negated forms of a claim, enabling the system to capture supporting and contradicting information from diverse sources: Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google. These evidence sets are filtered, deduplicated, and aggregated across sources to form a unified and enriched knowledge base that better reflects the complexity of real-world information. This aggregated evidence is then used for claim verification using LLMs. We further enhance interpretability by analyzing model confidence scores to quantify and visualize inter-source disagreement. Through extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets with five LLMs, we show that knowledge aggregation not only improves claim verification but also reveals differences in source-specific reasoning. Our findings underscore the importance of embracing diversity, contradiction, and aggregation in evidence for building reliable and transparent claim verification systems"}

GOIMDA selects inputs by maximizing their expected influence on a user-specified goal functional, such as test loss, predictive entropy, or the value of an optimizer-recommended design. Leveraging first-order influence functions, we derive a tractable acquisition rule that combines the goal gradient, training-loss curvature, and candidate sensitivity to model parameters.

This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America.

We propose MAGT (Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport), a flow-like generator that learns a one-shot, manifold-aligned transport from a low-dimensional base distribution to the data space. Training is performed at a fixed Gaussian smoothing level, where the score is well-defined and numerically stable. We approximate this fixed-level score using a finite set of latent anchor points with self-normalized importance sampling, yielding a tractable objective. MAGT samples in a single forward pass, concentrates probability near the learned support, and induces an intrinsic density with respect to the manifold volume measure, enabling principled likelihood evaluation for generated samples.

In this work, we characterize both approximation and statistical properties of neural networks with smooth activations over the Sobolev space $W^{s,\\infty}([0,1]^d)$ for arbitrary smoothness $s>0$. We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors). In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size. This complexity control ensures statistical learnability under empirical risk minimization (ERM) and removes the impractical sparsity constraints commonly required in prior analyses."}

Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways."}

Claim verification, a.k.a. fact-checking, systems can help identify potential misinformation. However, their efficacy is limited by the knowledge sources that they rely on. Most automated claim verification systems depend on a single knowledge source and utilize the supporting evidence from that source; they ignore the disagreement of their source with others. This limits their knowledge coverage and transparency. To address these limitations, we present a novel system for open-domain claim verification (ODCV) that leverages large language models (LLMs), multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis. Our approach introduces a novel retrieval strategy that collects evidence for both the original and the negated forms of a claim, enabling the system to capture supporting and contradicting information from diverse sources: Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google. These evidence sets are filtered, deduplicated, and aggregated across sources to form a unified and enriched knowledge base that better reflects the complexity of real-world information. This aggregated evidence is then used for claim verification using LLMs. We further enhance interpretability by analyzing model confidence scores to quantify and visualize inter-source disagreement. Through extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets with five LLMs, we show that knowledge aggregation not only improves claim verification but also reveals differences in source-specific reasoning. Our findings underscore the importance of embracing diversity, contradiction, and aggregation in evidence for building reliable and transparent claim verification systems"}

Our work is motivated by the application of dynamic predictions in the decision-making process for primary biliary cholangitis patients. For these patients, serial biomarker measurements (e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels) are routinely collected to inform treating physicians of the risk of liver failure and guide clinical decision-making. Two popular statistical approaches to derive dynamic predictions are joint modelling and landmarking. However, recently, machine learning techniques have also been proposed. Each approach has its merits, and no single method exists to outperform all others. Consequently, obtaining the best possible survival estimates is challenging. Therefore, we extend the Super Learner framework to combine dynamic predictions from different models and procedures. Super Learner is an ensemble learning technique that allows users to combine different prediction algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and flexibility. It uses cross-validation and different objective functions of performance (e.g., squared loss) that suit specific applications to build the optimally weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. In our work, we pay special attention to appropriate objective functions for Super Learner to obtain the most optimal weighted combination of dynamic predictions. In our primary biliary cholangitis application, Super Learner presented unique benefits due to its ability to flexibly combine outputs from a diverse set of models with varying assumptions for equal or better predictive performance than any model fit separately."}

In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets involving unimodal and bimodal corruptions show our proposed $\\texttt{AV-CTTA}$ significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting."}

Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, the requirement for iterative interaction with an environment often necessitates computationally expensive simulators, leading to significant sample inefficiency. In this study, these challenges are addressed through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can replace conventional and costly smart grid simulators. The RL policy learning process is enhanced so that convergence can be achieved in a fraction of the time required by the original environment. The PINN-based surrogate is compared with other benchmark data-driven surrogate models. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying physical laws, the results show that the PINN surrogate is the only approach considered in this context that can obtain a strong RL policy even without access to samples from the true simulator. The results demonstrate that using PINN surrogates can accelerate training by 50% compared to RL training without a surrogate. This approach enables the rapid generation of performance scores similar to those produced by the original simulator."}

In this work, we propose a new class of prior distributions for BNNs, the Dirichlet scale mixture (DSM) prior, that addresses current limitations in Bayesian neural networks through structured, sparsity-inducing shrinkage. Theoretically, we derive general dependence structures and shrinkage results for DSM priors and show how they manifest under the geometry induced by neural networks. In experiments on simulated and real world data we find that the DSM priors encourages sparse networks through implicit feature selection, show robustness under adversarial attacks and deliver competitive predictive performance with substantially fewer effective parameters. In particular, their advantages appear most pronounced in correlated, moderately small data regimes, and are more amenable to weight pruning. Moreover, by adopting heavy-tailed shrinkage mechanisms, our approach aligns with recent findings that such priors can mitigate the cold posterior effect, offering a principled alternative to the commonly used Gaussian priors."}

Preliminary version of an ongoing project that will be expanded with furhter evaluations", "summary": "We study post-calibration uncertainty for trained ensembles of classifiers. Specifically, we consider both aleatoric (label noise) and epistemic (model) uncertainty. Among the most popular and widely used calibration methods in classification are temperature scaling (i.e., pool-then-calibrate) and conformal methods. However, the main shortcoming of these calibration methods is that they do not balance the proportion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Not balancing these uncertainties can severely misrepresent predictive uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions in some input regions while being underconfident in others. To address this shortcoming, we present a simple but powerful calibration algorithm Joint Uncertainty Calibration (JUCAL) that jointly calibrates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. JUCAL jointly calibrates two constants to weight and scale epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by optimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) on the validation/calibration dataset. JUCAL can be applied to any trained ensemble of classifiers (e.g., transformers, CNNs, or tree-based methods), with minimal computational overhead, without requiring access to the models' internal parameters. We experimentally evaluate JUCAL on various text classification tasks, for ensembles of varying sizes and with different ensembling strategies. Our experiments show that JUCAL significantly outperforms SOTA calibration methods across all considered classification tasks, reducing NLL and predictive set size by up to 15% and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, even applying JUCAL to an ensemble of size 5 can outperform temperature-scaled ensembles of size up to 50 in terms of NLL and predictive set size, resulting in up to 10 times smaller inference costs. Thus, we propose JUCAL as a new go-to method for calibrating ensembles in classification."}

This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization."}

This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $μ$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $μ$ is \\emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \\textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \\emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions."}

In practice, influence is often measured through the effect of an example on parameter updates. To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget."}

Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions.

Since training MTL models for all possible combinations of tasks is prohibitively expensive for large task sets, a crucial component of efficient and effective task grouping is predicting whether a group of tasks would benefit from learning together, measured as per-task performance gain over single-task learning. In this paper, we propose ETAP (Ensemble Task Affinity Predictor), a scalable framework that integrates principled and data-driven estimators to predict MTL performance gains. First, we consider the gradient-based updates of shared parameters in an MTL model to measure the affinity between a pair of tasks as the similarity between the parameter updates based on these tasks. This linear estimator, which we call affinity score, naturally extends to estimating affinity within a group of tasks. Second, to refine these estimates, we train predictors that apply non-linear transformations and correct residual errors, capturing complex and non-linear task relationships. We train these predictors on a limited number of task groups for which we obtain ground-truth gain values via multi-task learning for each group. We demonstrate on benchmark datasets that ETAP improves MTL gain prediction and enables more effective task grouping, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse application domains."}

MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries.

We establish this causally using a natural experiment that holds model capability and task difficulty fixed by construction. We analyze trajectories from the Toolathlon benchmark: 22 frontier models each attempt 108 real-world tool-use tasks across 3 independent runs, yielding 515 model$\\times$task units where the same model succeeds on some runs and fails on others due to LLM sampling stochasticity alone.

Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection.

At the neuron level, we uncover a surprisingly large overlap: more than half of the top-activated units during multi-step inference are shared between representative LLMs and LVLMs, revealing a modality-invariant inference subspace.\n  Through causal probing via activation amplification, we further show that these shared neurons encode consistent and interpretable concept-level effects, demonstrating their functional contribution to inference. Building on this insight, we propose Shared Neuron Low-Rank Fusion (SNRF), a parameter-efficient framework that transfers mature inference circuitry from LLMs to LVLMs. SNRF profiles cross-model activations to identify shared neurons, computes a low-rank approximation of inter-model weight differences, and injects these updates selectively within the shared-neuron subspace. This mechanism strengthens multimodal inference performance with minimal parameter changes and requires no large-scale multimodal fine-tuning.\n  Across diverse mathematics and perception benchmarks, SNRF consistently enhances LVLM inference performance while preserving perceptual capabilities.

We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning."}

In this regime, personalization requires balancing general knowledge with personalized knowledge, yet existing approaches largely rely on heuristic mixing rules and lack theoretical justification. Moreover, prior model merging approaches are also computation and communication intensive, making the process inefficient in federated settings. In this work, we propose Potara, a principled framework for federated personalization that constructs a personalized model for each client by merging two complementary models: (i) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (ii) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Through the construct of linear mode connectivity, we show that the expected task loss admits a variance trace upper bound, whose minimization yields closed-form optimal mixing weights that guarantee a tighter bound for the merged model than for either the federated or local model alone. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that Potara consistently improves personalization while reducing communication, leading to a strong performance-communication trade-off."}

Motivated by their shared transformer architectures, we investigate whether the two model families rely on common internal computation for such inference. At the neuron level, we uncover a surprisingly large overlap: more than half of the top-activated units during multi-step inference are shared between representative LLMs and LVLMs, revealing a modality-invariant inference subspace.\n  Through causal probing via activation amplification, we further show that these shared neurons encode consistent and interpretable concept-level effects, demonstrating their functional contribution to inference. Building on this insight, we propose Shared Neuron Low-Rank Fusion (SNRF), a parameter-efficient framework that transfers mature inference circuitry from LLMs to LVLMs. SNRF profiles cross-model activations to identify shared neurons, computes a low-rank approximation of inter-model weight differences, and injects these updates selectively within the shared-neuron subspace. This mechanism strengthens multimodal inference performance with minimal parameter changes and requires no large-scale multimodal fine-tuning.\n  Across diverse mathematics and perception benchmarks, SNRF consistently enhances LVLM inference performance while preserving perceptual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that shared neurons form an interpretable bridge between LLMs and LVLMs, enabling low-cost transfer of inference ability into multimodal models.

We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence."}

Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees.

Multi-hop reasoning, which requires models to engage in deliberate thinking and multi-step interaction, serves as a critical testbed for assessing such capabilities. However, existing benchmarks typically provide only final questions and answers, while lacking the intermediate hop-level questions that gradually connect atomic questions to the final multi-hop query. This limitation prevents researchers from analyzing at which step an agent fails and restricts more fine-grained evaluation of model capabilities. Moreover, most current benchmarks are manually constructed, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while also limiting scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticRAGTracer, the first Agentic RAG benchmark that is primarily constructed automatically by large language models and designed to support step-by-step validation. Our benchmark spans multiple domains, contains 1,305 data points, and has no overlap with existing mainstream benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even the best large language models perform poorly on our dataset. For instance, GPT-5 attains merely 22.6\\% EM accuracy on the hardest portion of our dataset. Hop-aware diagnosis reveals that failures are primarily driven by distorted reasoning chains -- either collapsing prematurely or wandering into over-extension. This highlights a critical inability to allocate steps consistent with the task's logical structure, providing a diagnostic dimension missing in traditional evaluations. We believe our work will facilitate research in Agentic RAG and inspire further meaningful progress in this area. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YqjMartin/AgenticRAGTracer."}

We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold.

From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model.

However, the action space of insertion models is much larger than that of autoregressive models (ARMs) making the learning challenging. To address this, we incorporate trainable order dynamics into the target rates for discrete flow matching, and show that with suitable choices of parameterizations, joint training of the target order dynamics and the generator is tractable without the need for numerical simulation. As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality. On de novo small molecule generation, we find that the learned order dynamics leads to an increase in the number of valid molecules generated and improved quality, when compared to uniform order dynamics."}

Multi-hop reasoning, which requires models to engage in deliberate thinking and multi-step interaction, serves as a critical testbed for assessing such capabilities. However, existing benchmarks typically provide only final questions and answers, while lacking the intermediate hop-level questions that gradually connect atomic questions to the final multi-hop query. This limitation prevents researchers from analyzing at which step an agent fails and restricts more fine-grained evaluation of model capabilities. Moreover, most current benchmarks are manually constructed, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while also limiting scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticRAGTracer, the first Agentic RAG benchmark that is primarily constructed automatically by large language models and designed to support step-by-step validation. Our benchmark spans multiple domains, contains 1,305 data points, and has no overlap with existing mainstream benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even the best large language models perform poorly on our dataset. For instance, GPT-5 attains merely 22.6\\% EM accuracy on the hardest portion of our dataset. Hop-aware diagnosis reveals that failures are primarily driven by distorted reasoning chains -- either collapsing prematurely or wandering into over-extension. This highlights a critical inability to allocate steps consistent with the task's logical structure, providing a diagnostic dimension missing in traditional evaluations. We believe our work will facilitate research in Agentic RAG and inspire further meaningful progress in this area. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YqjMartin/AgenticRAGTracer."}

This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the \"greedy\" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $Θ(\\log N)$ (resp., $Θ({(N \\log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients.

In this paper, we propose \\emph{Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning} for MVC: we explicitly model cross-view directional agreement as a phase term and combine it with a nonnegative magnitude backbone to form a complex-valued magnetic affinity, extract a stable shared spectral signal via a Hermitian magnetic Laplacian, and use it as structured self-supervision to guide unsupervised multi-view representation learning and clustering. To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines."}

We introduce a continuous dominance indicator (T-score) that maps final scores to real values consistent with win/lose outcomes, and formulate it as a time-evolving stochastic representation (T-process) driven by standardized cumulative statistics. This structure captures temporal game dynamics and enables sequential, analytically tractable updates of in-game win probability. Through this stochastic formulation, competitive advantage is decomposed into interpretable statistical components. Furthermore, we define a latent contribution index, STATS X, which quantifies a player's involvement in favorable dominance intervals identified by the T-process. This allows us to separate a team's baseline strength from game-specific performance fluctuations and provides a coherent, structural evaluation framework for both teams and players. While we do not implement AI methods in this paper, our framework is positioned as a foundational step toward hybrid integration with AI. By providing a structured time-series representation of dominance with an explicit probabilistic interpretation, the framework enables flexible learning mechanisms and incorporation of high-dimensional data, while preserving statistical coherence and interpretability.

A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.\n  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.\n  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data. These results demonstrate that low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization and highlight the importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage."}

In low-resource languages such as Bengali, automated detection remains challenging due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and pervasive code-mixing. To address these issues, we augment the Bengali Hateful Memes (BHM) dataset with semantically aligned samples from the Multimodal Aggression Dataset in Bengali (MIMOSA), improving both class balance and semantic diversity. We propose the Enhanced Dual Co-attention Framework (xDORA), integrating vision encoders (CLIP, DINOv2) and multilingual text encoders (XGLM, XLM-R) via weighted attention pooling to learn robust cross-modal representations. Building on these embeddings, we develop a FAISS-based k-nearest neighbor classifier for non-parametric inference and introduce RAG-Fused DORA, which incorporates retrieval-driven contextual reasoning. We further evaluate LLaVA under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented prompting settings. Experiments on the extended dataset show that xDORA (CLIP + XLM-R) achieves macro-average F1-scores of 0.78 for hateful meme identification and 0.71 for target entity detection, while RAG-Fused DORA improves performance to 0.79 and 0.74, yielding gains over the DORA baseline. The FAISS-based classifier performs competitively and demonstrates robustness for rare classes through semantic similarity modeling. In contrast, LLaVA exhibits limited effectiveness in few-shot settings, with only modest improvements under retrieval augmentation, highlighting constraints of pretrained vision-language models for code-mixed Bengali content without fine-tuning. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of supervised, retrieval-augmented, and non-parametric multimodal frameworks for addressing linguistic and cultural complexities in low-resource hate speech detection."}

In contrast, prompt- and RAG-based signals are easy to apply but can be diluted in long dialogues, leading to drifting and sometimes inconsistent persona behavior. To address this, we propose a contrastive Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) framework that learns facet-level personality control vectors aligned with the Big Five 30-facet model. A new 15,000-sample leakage-controlled corpus is constructed to provide balanced supervision for each facet. The learned vectors are integrated into the model's residual space and dynamically selected by a trait-activated routing module, enabling precise and interpretable personality steering. Experiments on Large Language Models (LLMs) show that the proposed method maintains stable character fidelity and output quality across contextualized settings, outperforming Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and prompt-only baselines.

Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $α$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $α$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \\pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $α< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $α$ and expert agreement (Spearman $ρ= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning.

PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average.

PR2 learns adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, determining when to retrieve, what evidence to retrieve from user profiles, and how to incorporate it into intermediate reasoning steps. By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model.

Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coefficients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations. In a Monte Carlo study spanning 21 data-generating configurations with up to 50 predictors, CAVI produces posterior means nearly identical to a block Gibbs sampler benchmark while achieving speedups of 107x to 1,772x (Table 9).

The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline. Furthermore, discussions on CAV proportions and powertrain types are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed method with the impact of automation and electrification."}

Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks."}

While deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as an efficient alternative to conventional ray-tracing for radio map estimation (RME), most existing DL approaches are confined to 2D near-ground scenarios. They often fail to capture essential 3D signal propagation characteristics and antenna polarization effects, primarily due to the scarcity of 3D data and training challenges. To address these limitations, we present the RadioGen3D framework. First, we propose an efficient data synthesis method to generate high-quality 3D radio map data. By establishing a parametric target model that captures 2D ray-tracing and 3D channel fading characteristics, we derive realistic coefficient combinations from minimal real measurements, enabling the construction of a large-scale synthetic dataset, Radio3DMix. Utilizing this dataset, we propose a 3D model training scheme based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), yielding a 3D U-Net capable of accurate RME under diverse input feature combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioGen3D surpasses all baselines in both estimation accuracy and speed. Furthermore, fine-tuning experiments verify its strong generalization capability via successful knowledge transfer."}

In low-resource languages such as Bengali, automated detection remains challenging due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and pervasive code-mixing. To address these issues, we augment the Bengali Hateful Memes (BHM) dataset with semantically aligned samples from the Multimodal Aggression Dataset in Bengali (MIMOSA), improving both class balance and semantic diversity. We propose the Enhanced Dual Co-attention Framework (xDORA), integrating vision encoders (CLIP, DINOv2) and multilingual text encoders (XGLM, XLM-R) via weighted attention pooling to learn robust cross-modal representations. Building on these embeddings, we develop a FAISS-based k-nearest neighbor classifier for non-parametric inference and introduce RAG-Fused DORA, which incorporates retrieval-driven contextual reasoning. We further evaluate LLaVA under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented prompting settings. Experiments on the extended dataset show that xDORA (CLIP + XLM-R) achieves macro-average F1-scores of 0.78 for hateful meme identification and 0.71 for target entity detection, while RAG-Fused DORA improves performance to 0.79 and 0.74, yielding gains over the DORA baseline. The FAISS-based classifier performs competitively and demonstrates robustness for rare classes through semantic similarity modeling. In contrast, LLaVA exhibits limited effectiveness in few-shot settings, with only modest improvements under retrieval augmentation, highlighting constraints of pretrained vision-language models for code-mixed Bengali content without fine-tuning.

The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of \"one-model-for-one-dataset\", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings."}

Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods.

Even after an incident is reported as resolved, disruptions can induce irregular train operations that generate substantial uncertainty in passenger waiting and travel times. Accurately forecasting post-disruption travel times therefore remains a critical challenge for transit operators and passenger information systems. This paper develops a Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling framework for post-disruption train travel times that explicitly captures train interactions, headway imbalance, and non-Gaussian distributional characteristics observed during recovery periods. The proposed model decomposes travel times into delay and journey components and incorporates a moving-average error structure to represent dependence between consecutive trains. Skew-normal and skew-$t$ distributions are employed to flexibly accommodate heteroskedasticity, skewness, and heavy-tailed behavior in post-disruption travel times. The framework is evaluated using high-resolution track-occupancy and disruption log data from the Montréal metro system, covering two lines in both travel directions. Empirical results indicate that post-disruption travel times exhibit pronounced distributional asymmetries that vary with traveled distance, as well as significant error dependence across trains. The proposed models consistently outperform baseline specifications in both point prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification, with the skew-$t$ model demonstrating the most robust performance for longer journeys. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both distributional flexibility and error dependence when forecasting post-disruption travel times in urban rail systems."}

However, in the short train long test setting, autoregressive rollouts can become unstable. This typically happens for two reasons: one step errors accumulate over time, and high frequency components feed back and grow.\n  We introduce the Spectral Generator Neural Operator (SGNO), a residual time stepper that targets both effects. For the linear part, SGNO uses an exponential time differencing update in Fourier space with a learned diagonal generator. We constrain the real part of this generator to be nonpositive, so iterating the step does not amplify the linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamics, SGNO adds a gated forcing term with channel mixing within each Fourier mode, which keeps the nonlinear update controlled. To further limit high frequency feedback, SGNO applies spectral truncation and an optional smooth mask on the forcing pathway.\n  We derive a one step amplification bound and a finite horizon rollout error bound. The bound separates generator approximation error from nonlinear mismatch and gives sufficient conditions under which the latent $L^2$ norm does not grow across rollout steps. On APEBench spanning 1D, 2D, and 3D PDE families, SGNO achieves lower long horizon error and longer stable rollout lengths than strong neural operator baselines. Ablations confirm the roles of the generator constraint, gating, and filtering.The code is available at https://github.com/lijy32123-cloud/SGNO."}

Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \\textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods."}

Such sparse networks can lower the demand for computational resources at inference, and during training. The existence of the LTH and corresponding sparse subnetworks in BNNs could motivate the development of sparse training algorithms and provide valuable insights into the underlying training process. Towards this end, we translate the LTH experiments to a Bayesian setting using common computer vision models. We investigate the defining characteristics of Bayesian lottery tickets, and extend our study towards a transplantation method connecting BNNs with deterministic Lottery Tickets. We generally find that the LTH holds in BNNs, and winning tickets of matching and surpassing accuracy are present independent of model size, with degradation at very high sparsities.

Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods.

In practice, feature learning plays an important role across both stages: deep neural networks learn a broad range of useful features during pretraining and further refine those features during fine-tuning. However, an end-to-end theoretical understanding of how choices of initialization impact the ability to reuse and refine features during fine-tuning has remained elusive. Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100. Overall, our results demonstrate analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting an important role for the relative scale of initialization across different layers in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning."}

As a result, most GNNs rely on local approximations such as polynomial Laplacian filters or message passing, which limit their ability to model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters."}

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Hyper-KGGen}, a skill-driven framework that reformulates extraction as a dynamic skill-evolving process. First, Hyper-KGGen employs a \\textit{coarse-to-fine} mechanism to systematically decompose documents, ensuring full-dimensional coverage from binary links to complex hyperedges.

Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\\widetilde O(\\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\\widetilde O(\\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\\mathsf{TC}$ and $\\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K<L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design."}

We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \\approx 1$ persists throughout.

Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point."}

We study vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences and identify stability conditions under which aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones.\n  We formalize this stability property as \\emph{$(α,β)$-boostability}. We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry. For vector-valued prediction and conditional density estimation, we characterize boostability under common divergences ($\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$, $\\TV$, and $\\Hel$) with geometric median, revealing a sharp distinction between dimension-dependent and dimension-free regimes. We further show that while KL divergence is not directly boostable via geometric median aggregation, it can be handled indirectly through boostability under Hellinger distance.\n  Building on these structural results, we propose a generic boosting framework \\textsc{GeoMedBoost} based on exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. Under a weak learner condition and $(α,β)$-boostability, we obtain exponential decay of the empirical divergence exceedance error.

Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges.

The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts.

At the instance level, we redefine reasoning traces as executable process specifications and introduce blind execution verification to assess operational validity. At the local structural level, we construct feasible-region DAGs via structure-consistent perturbations, enabling explicit characterization of reasoning stability and the executable region in the local input space. At the class level, we introduce a causal failure mode analysis method that identifies recurring structural failure patterns and quantifies their causal influence using Shapley values. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework provides multi-level, verifiable explanations, including executable reasoning structures for individual instances, feasible-region representations for neighboring inputs, and interpretable failure modes with quantified importance at the class level.

Without it, every cross-dataspace policy comparison defaults to Unknown. We present a denotational semantics that maps each ODRL constraint to the set of knowledge-base concepts satisfying it. Conflict detection reduces to denotation intersection under a three-valued verdict -- Conflict, Compatible, or Unknown -- that is sound under incomplete knowledge. The framework covers all three ODRL composition modes (and, or, xone) and all three semantic domains arising in practice: taxonomic (class subsumption), mereological (part-whole containment), and nominal (identity). For cross-dataspace interoperability, we define order-preserving alignments between knowledge bases and prove two guarantees: conflicts are preserved across different KB standards, and unmapped concepts degrade gracefully to Unknown -- never to false conflicts. A runtime soundness theorem ensures that design-time verdicts hold for all execution contexts. The encoding stays within the decidable EPR fragment of first-order logic. We validate it with 154 benchmarks across six knowledge base families (GeoNames, ISO 3166, W3C DPV, a GDPR-derived taxonomy, BCP 47, and ISO 639-3) and four structural KBs targeting adversarial edge cases. Both the Vampire theorem prover and the Z3 SMT solver agree on all 154 verdicts. A key finding is that exclusive composition (xone) requires strictly stronger KB axioms than conjunction or disjunction: open-world semantics blocks exclusivity even when positive evidence appears to satisfy exactly one branch."}

However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics."}

Five of ODRL's approximately 34 left operands, however, denote multi-dimensional quantities--image dimensions, canvas positions, geographic coordinates--whose specification text explicitly references multiple axes. For these operands, a single scalar constraint admits one interpretation per axis, making policy evaluation non-deterministic.\n  We classify ODRL's left operands by value-domain structure (scalar, dimensional, concept-valued), grounded in the ODRL 2.2 specification text, and show that dimensional ambiguity is intrinsic to the constraint syntax.\n  We present an axis-decomposition framework that refines each dimensional operand into axis-specific scalar operands and prove four properties: deterministic interpretation, AABB completeness, sound over-approximation under projection, and conservative extension.\n  Conflict detection operates in two layers: per-axis verdicts are always decidable; box-level verdicts compose through Strong Kleene conjunction into a three-valued logic (Conflict, Compatible, Unknown). For ODRL's disjunctive (odrl:or) and exclusive-or (odrl:xone) logical constraints, where per-axis decomposition does not apply, the framework encodes coupled multi-axis conjectures directly.\n  We instantiate the framework as the ODRL Spatial Axis Profile--15 axis-specific left operands for the five affected base terms--and evaluate it on 117 benchmark problems spanning nine categories across both TPTP FOF (Vampire) and SMT-LIB (Z3) encodings, achieving full concordance between provers.

We calibrate each scale for each capability (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, volume, etc.) by compiling publicly released human test data spanning education and reasoning benchmarks (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, and ReliabilityBench).

Without it, every cross-dataspace policy comparison defaults to Unknown. We present a denotational semantics that maps each ODRL constraint to the set of knowledge-base concepts satisfying it. Conflict detection reduces to denotation intersection under a three-valued verdict -- Conflict, Compatible, or Unknown -- that is sound under incomplete knowledge. The framework covers all three ODRL composition modes (and, or, xone) and all three semantic domains arising in practice: taxonomic (class subsumption), mereological (part-whole containment), and nominal (identity). For cross-dataspace interoperability, we define order-preserving alignments between knowledge bases and prove two guarantees: conflicts are preserved across different KB standards, and unmapped concepts degrade gracefully to Unknown -- never to false conflicts. A runtime soundness theorem ensures that design-time verdicts hold for all execution contexts. The encoding stays within the decidable EPR fragment of first-order logic. We validate it with 154 benchmarks across six knowledge base families (GeoNames, ISO 3166, W3C DPV, a GDPR-derived taxonomy, BCP 47, and ISO 639-3) and four structural KBs targeting adversarial edge cases. Both the Vampire theorem prover and the Z3 SMT solver agree on all 154 verdicts. A key finding is that exclusive composition (xone) requires strictly stronger KB axioms than conjunction or disjunction: open-world semantics blocks exclusivity even when positive evidence appears to satisfy exactly one branch."}

Existing MIAs often rely on impractical assumptions such as access to public datasets, shadow models, confidence scores, or training data distribution knowledge and making them vulnerable to defenses like confidence masking and adversarial regularization. Label-only MIAs, even under strict constraints suffer from high query requirements per sample. We propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction. By querying the target model M using active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data, we extract a functionally similar surrogate S on which membership inference is performed. This shifts query overhead to a one-time extraction phase, eliminating repeated queries to M . Operating under strict black-box constraints, our method matches the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while significantly reducing query costs. On benchmarks including Purchase, Location, and Texas Hospital, we show that a query budget equivalent to testing $\\approx1\\%$ of training samples suffices to extract S and achieve membership inference accuracy within $\\pm1\\%$ of M .

Attention-based re-ranking methods, which derive relevance scores directly from attention weights, offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to generation-based re-ranking methods. However, they still face two major limitations. First, attention signals are highly concentrated a small subset of tokens within a few documents, making others indistinguishable. Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens. Both adjustments operate directly on existing attention weights without additional training or supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent."}

However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness\", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference."}

Attention-based re-ranking methods, which derive relevance scores directly from attention weights, offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to generation-based re-ranking methods. However, they still face two major limitations. First, attention signals are highly concentrated a small subset of tokens within a few documents, making others indistinguishable. Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens. Both adjustments operate directly on existing attention weights without additional training or supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

By treating sequences as independent samples, however, these methods overlook affinity maturation as a rich and largely untapped source of information about the evolutionary process by which antibodies explore the underlying fitness landscape. In contrast, classical phylogenetic models explicitly represent evolutionary dynamics but lack the expressivity to capture complex epistatic interactions. We bridge this gap with CoSiNE, a continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by a deep neural network. Mathematically, we prove that CoSiNE provides a first-order approximation to the intractable sequential point mutation process, capturing epistatic effects with an error bound that is quadratic in branch length. Empirically, CoSiNE outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by explicitly disentangling selection from context-dependent somatic hypermutation. Finally, we introduce Guided Gillespie, a classifier-guided sampling scheme that steers CoSiNE at inference time, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity toward specific antigens."}

However, this algebraic framework diverges from the reality of digital computation with finite-precision hardware. In this work, we analyze the theoretical complexity of ERM under a realistic bit-level model ($\\mathsf{ERM}_{\\text{bit}}$), where network parameters and inputs are constrained to be rational numbers with polynomially bounded bit-lengths. Under this model, we reveal a sharp dichotomy in tractability governed by the network's activation function. We prove that for deep networks with {\\em any} polynomial activations with rational coefficients and degree at least $2$, the bit-complexity of training is severe: deciding $\\mathsf{ERM}_{\\text{bit}}$ is $\\#P$-Hard, hence believed to be strictly harder than NP-complete problems. Furthermore, we show that determining the sign of a single partial derivative of the empirical loss function is intractable (unlikely in BPP), and deciding a specific bit in the gradient is $\\#P$-Hard. This provides a complexity-theoretic perspective for the phenomenon of exploding and vanishing gradients. In contrast, we show that for piecewise-linear activations such as ReLU, the precision requirements remain manageable: $\\mathsf{ERM}_{\\text{bit}}$ is contained within NP (specifically NP-complete), and standard backpropagation runs in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that finite-precision constraints are not merely implementation details but fundamental determinants of learnability."}

We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss.

By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors.

Nonetheless, this extension introduces both theoretical and practical challenges. From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable. To overcome these challenges, we first provide a theoretical result demonstrating that our inverse formulation admits a unique solution, thereby ensuring valid optimization.

Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output.

To track variation in the comprehension abilities of LLMs, we prompt 3 popular models on a language comprehension task across 12 languages, representing the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, and Japonic language families. Our results suggest that the models exhibit remarkable linguistic accuracy across typologically diverse languages, yet they fall behind human baselines in all of them, albeit to different degrees. Contrary to what was expected, English is not the best-performing language, as it was systematically outperformed by several Romance languages, even lower-resource ones. We frame the results by discussing the role of several factors that drive LLM performance, such as tokenization, language distance from Spanish and English, size of training data, and data origin in high- vs. low-resource languages and WEIRD vs. non-WEIRD communities."}

Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain."}

In realistic retrieval settings, the retrieved document set often contains a mixture of documents that vary in relevance and usefulness. While prior work has largely examined these phenomena through output behavior, little is known about how retrieved context shapes the internal representations that mediate information integration in RAG. In this work, we study RAG through the lens of latent representations. We systematically analyze how different types of retrieved documents affect the hidden states of LLMs, and how these internal representation shifts relate to downstream generation behavior. Across four question-answering datasets and three LLMs, we analyze internal representations under controlled single- and multi-document settings. Our results reveal how context relevancy and layer-wise processing influence internal representations, providing explanations on LLMs output behaviors and insights for RAG system design."}

While these operators are traditionally analyzed through spectral decompositions, their connection to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) has not been systematically explored within the algebraic signal processing framework. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive theory showing that the range of integral operators naturally induces RKHS convolutional signal models whose reproducing kernels are determined by a box product of the operator symbols. We characterize the algebraic and spectral properties of these induced RKHS and show that polynomial filtering with integral operators corresponds to iterated box products, giving rise to a unital kernel algebra. This perspective yields pointwise RKHS representations of filters via the reproducing property, providing an alternative to operator-based implementations. Our results establish precise connections between eigendecompositions and RKHS representations in graphon signal processing, extend naturally to directed graphons, and enable novel spatial--spectral localization results. Furthermore, we show that when the spectral domain is a subset of the original domain of the signals, optimal filters for regularized learning problems admit finite-dimensional RKHS representations, providing a principled foundation for learnable filters in integral-operator-based neural architectures."}

While sign-based optimizers such as I-FGSM and MI-FGSM have become the de facto standard for the induced optimization problems, there still exist several unsolved problems in theoretical grounding and practical reliability especially in non-convergence and instability, which inevitably influences their transferability. Contrary to the expectation, we observe that the attack success rate may degrade sharply when more number of iterations are conducted. In this paper, we address these issues from an optimization perspective. By reformulating the sign-based optimizer as a specific coordinate-wise gradient descent, we argue that one cause for non-convergence and instability is their non-decaying step-size scheduling. Based upon this viewpoint, we propose a series of new attack algorithms that enforce Monotonically Decreasing Coordinate-wise Step-sizes (MDCS) within sign-based optimizers. Typically, we further provide theoretical guarantees proving that MDCS-MI attains an optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Extensive experiments on image classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves transferability but also enhances attack stability compared to state-of-the-art sign-based methods."}

Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts.

This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency.

Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $ε$- and $η$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification."}

In contrast to approaches that reduce AI bias solely to dataset composition or to the projection of human intentionality, we argue that a significant class of biases emerges directly from the technical mechanisms of the models themselves: tokenization, attention, statistical optimization, and alignment procedures. By framing bias as an infrastructural phenomenon, this approach resolves a central theoretical ambiguity surrounding responsibility, neutrality, and correction in contemporary LLMs. Based on a comparative analysis of tokenization across a corpus of parallel sentences, we show that Arabic languages (Modern Standard Arabic and Maghrebi dialects) undergo a systematic inflation in token count relative to English, with ratios ranging from 1.6x to nearly 4x depending on the infrastructure (OpenAI, Anthropic, SentencePiece/Mistral). This over-segmentation constitutes a measurable infrastructural bias that mechanically increases inference costs, constrains access to contextual space, and alters attentional weighting within model representations. We relate these empirical findings to three additional structural mechanisms: causal bias (correlation vs causation), the erasure of minoritized features through dimensional collapse, and normative biases induced by safety alignment.

This study proposed a natural language processing (NLP)-based framework to evaluate ethical aspects from user-generated reviews from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. After gathering and cleaning the data, topic modeling was applied to identify latent themes in the context of ethics using topic words and then map them to well-recognized existing ethical principles described in different ethical frameworks; in addition to that, a bottom-up approach is applied to find any new and emergent ethics from the reviews using a transformer-based zero-shot classification model. Sentiment analysis was then used to capture how users feel about each ethical aspect. The obtained results reveal that well-known ethical considerations are not enough for the modern AI-based technologies and are missing emerging ethical challenges, showing how these apps either uphold or overlook key moral values. This work contributes to developing an ongoing evaluation system that can enhance the fairness, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI-powered mental health chatbots."}

For instance, prior work, VeLO, scaled meta-training to 4,000 TPU months ($\\sim$10$\\times$ GPT-3 compute) to meta-train a general-purpose optimizer but it failed to generalize beyond 600M parameters tasks. In this work, we present a surprising finding: by crafting a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmenting meta-training, it becomes feasible to meta-train a performant general-purpose learned update rule on a tiny fraction of VeLO compute, 4.5 GPU hours to be precise. Our learned update rule scales stably to a billion-scale pretraining task (GPT-3 XL 1.3B) which is six orders of magnitude larger than its meta-training distribution. Furthermore, it shows strong performance across diverse out-of-distribution tasks and is compatible with modern optimization harness that includes orthogonalization, distinct update rules for input-output and hidden weights, and decoupled weight decay. In all, this work paves the way for practically applicable learnable optimization algorithms, unlocking exploration of richer meta-training and data curation recipes to further improve performance."}

We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning."}

We interrogate this assumption using SP-ABCBench, a new benchmark of 30 tests derived from validated S&P human-subject studies, which measures alignment between simulations and human-subjects studies on a 0-100 ascending scale, where higher scores indicate better alignment across three dimensions: Attitude, Behavior, and Coherence.

In contrast to approaches that reduce AI bias solely to dataset composition or to the projection of human intentionality, we argue that a significant class of biases emerges directly from the technical mechanisms of the models themselves: tokenization, attention, statistical optimization, and alignment procedures. By framing bias as an infrastructural phenomenon, this approach resolves a central theoretical ambiguity surrounding responsibility, neutrality, and correction in contemporary LLMs. Based on a comparative analysis of tokenization across a corpus of parallel sentences, we show that Arabic languages (Modern Standard Arabic and Maghrebi dialects) undergo a systematic inflation in token count relative to English, with ratios ranging from 1.6x to nearly 4x depending on the infrastructure (OpenAI, Anthropic, SentencePiece/Mistral). This over-segmentation constitutes a measurable infrastructural bias that mechanically increases inference costs, constrains access to contextual space, and alters attentional weighting within model representations. We relate these empirical findings to three additional structural mechanisms: causal bias (correlation vs causation), the erasure of minoritized features through dimensional collapse, and normative biases induced by safety alignment. Finally, we propose a framework for a technical clinic of models, grounded in the audit of tokenization regimes, latent space topology, and alignment systems, as a necessary condition for the critical appropriation of AI infrastructures."}

Even without any margin or stochastic assumptions, realizability may enforce horizon-free (finite) cumulative loss under metric-like losses, even when the analogous classification problem has an infinite mistake bound. We study realizable online regression in the adversarial model under losses that satisfy an approximate triangle inequality (approximate pseudo-metrics). Recent work of Attias et al. shows that the minimax realizable cumulative loss is characterized by the scaled Littlestone/online dimension $\\mathbb{D}_{\\mathrm{onl}}$, but this quantity can be difficult to analyze.\n  Our main contribution is a generic potential method that upper bounds $\\mathbb{D}_{\\mathrm{onl}}$ by a concrete Dudley-type entropy integral that depends only on covering numbers of the hypothesis class under the induced sup pseudo-metric.

We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs."}

Existing data generation approaches rely on open-loop pipelines and fixed modifications that do not adapt to the model's capabilities. Furthermore, they typically operate directly on word problems, limiting control over problem structure. To address this, we perform modifications in a symbolic problem space, representing each problem as a set of symbolic variables and constraints (e.g., via algebraic frameworks such as SymPy or SMT formulations). This representation enables precise control over problem structure, automatic generation of ground-truth solutions, and decouples mathematical reasoning from linguistic realization. We also show that this results in more diverse generations. To adapt the problem difficulty to the model, we introduce a closed-loop framework that learns modification strategies through prompt optimization in symbolic space. Experimental results demonstrate that both adaptive problem generation and symbolic representation modifications contribute to improving the model's math solving ability."}

(2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step.

This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs."}

Because large foundation models are far from interpretable, understanding whether and how such knowledge persists remains a significant challenge. To address this, we turn to the recently developed framework of combinatorial interpretability. This framework, designed for two-layer neural networks, enables direct inspection of the knowledge encoded in the model weights. We reproduce baseline unlearning methods within the combinatorial interpretability setting and examine their behavior along two dimensions: (i) whether they truly remove knowledge of a target concept (the concept we wish to remove) or merely inhibit its expression while retaining the underlying information, and (ii) how easily the supposedly erased knowledge can be recovered through various fine-tuning operations. Our results shed light within a fully interpretable setting on how knowledge can persist despite unlearning and when it might resurface."}

We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples.

Like software execution, LLM agents operate sequentially, allowing hook actions to be inserted at decision points without disrupting task flow. When the activation key is present, an LLM agent trained on watermarked trajectories can produce these hook actions at a significantly higher rate, enabling reliable black-box detection. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, web searching, and software engineering agents show that ActHook achieves an average detection AUC of 94.3 on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B while incurring negligible performance degradation."}

Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS).

We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%). These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning-steered discrete diffusion, once extended to handle directionality, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures."}

Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, structural analysis via AlphaFold3 confirms that the generated sequences preserve the canonical capsid folding despite sequence diversification. AAVGen establishes a foundation for data-driven viral vector engineering, accelerating the development of next-generation AAV vectors with tailored functional characteristics."}

While spectral bias is often treated as an intrinsic representational limitation of neural architectures, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood. In this work, we provide a systematic investigation of spectral bias in physics-informed and operator learning frameworks, with emphasis on the coupled roles of network architecture, activation functions, loss design, and optimization strategy. We quantify spectral bias through frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments, enabling a unified analysis across elliptic, hyperbolic, and dispersive PDEs. Through diverse benchmark problems, including the Korteweg-de Vries, wave and steady-state diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow reconstruction, and earthquake dynamics, we demonstrate that spectral bias is not simply representational but fundamentally dynamical. In particular, second-order optimization methods substantially alter the spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes for all PDE types. For neural operators, we further show that spectral bias is dependent on the neural operator architecture and can also be effectively mitigated through spectral-aware loss formulations without increasing the inference cost."}

Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, structural analysis via AlphaFold3 confirms that the generated sequences preserve the canonical capsid folding despite sequence diversification. AAVGen establishes a foundation for data-driven viral vector engineering, accelerating the development of next-generation AAV vectors with tailored functional characteristics."}

Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights."}

Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting.

However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques."}

We hypothesize that training data are \\textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \\textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \\textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data.

We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence."}

However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning."}

However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches."}

Their result is correct and important for practitioners who compute cosine similarity on embeddings trained with dot-product objectives. However, we argue that their conclusion, cautioning against cosine similarity in general, conflates the pathology of an incompatible training objective with the geometric validity of cosine distance on the unit sphere. We prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (either during or after training with an appropriate objective), the $D$-matrix ambiguity vanishes identically, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance. This monotonic equivalence implies that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings. The ``problem'' with cosine similarity is not cosine similarity, it is the failure to normalize."}

Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences.

Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs."}

This rigidity results in substantial computational waste, as resources are indiscriminately allocated to stagnating populations while promising frontiers remain under-exploited. We introduce AdaEvolve, a framework that reformulates LLM-driven evolution as a hierarchical adaptive optimization problem. AdaEvolve uses an \"accumulated improvement signal\" to unify decisions across three levels: Local Adaptation, which dynamically modulates the exploration intensity within a population of solution candidates; Global Adaptation, which routes the global resource budget via bandit-based scheduling across different solution candidate populations; and Meta-Guidance which generates novel solution tactics based on the previously generated solutions and their corresponding improvements when the progress stalls. We demonstrate that AdaEvolve consistently outperforms the open-sourced baselines across 185 different open-ended optimization problems including combinatorial, systems optimization and algorithm design problems."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations.

A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity."}

This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the \"greedy\" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $Θ(\\log N)$ (resp., $Θ({(N \\log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients.

While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification."}

While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics."}

Inspired by speculative decoding in language model inference and by the Automatically Scalable Computation (ASC) architecture for program execution, Leap+Verify decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a real-time Lyapunov proxy signal. Within each regime, analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion. We evaluate Leap+Verify on GPT-2 124M and Qwen 2.5-1.5B trained on WikiText-103 across five random seeds, sweeping prediction depth K in {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}. Momentum-based prediction (Adam moment extrapolation) fails catastrophically at both scales, with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x -- a universal norm explosion in optimizer-state extrapolation. Finite-difference predictors (linear, quadratic) succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34% of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64% in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints. Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable -- the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. Cross-seed results are highly consistent (less than 1% validation loss variance), and the three-regime framework produces identical phase boundaries (plus or minus 50 steps) across seeds."}

Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks."}

Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations."}

We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases.

Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coefficients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations.

However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (1) most models suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity, making it difficult to scale to large graphs; (2) attention mechanisms based on node-level operations limit the flexibility of the model and result in poor generalization performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{VecFormer} (the \\textbf{Vec}tor Quantized Graph Trans\\textbf{former}), an efficient and highly generalizable model for node classification, particularly under OOD settings. VecFormer adopts a two-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, two codebooks are used to reconstruct the node features and the graph structure, aiming to learn the rich semantic \\texttt{Graph Codes}. In the second stage, attention mechanisms are performed at the \\texttt{Graph Token} level based on the transformed cross codebook, reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on datasets of various sizes demonstrate that VecFormer outperforms the existing Graph Transformer in both performance and speed."}

Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks."}

However, anonymization can negatively affect the performance of Computer Vision systems that rely on visual features, such as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Despite this, the impact of anonymization on CBIR has not been systematically studied. This work addresses this gap, motivated by the DOKIQ project, an artificial intelligence-based system for document verification actively used by the State Criminal Police Office Baden-Württemberg. We propose a simple evaluation framework: retrieval results after anonymization should match those obtained before anonymization as closely as possible. To this end, we systematically assess the impact of anonymization using two public datasets and the internal DOKIQ dataset. Our experiments span three anonymization methods, four anonymization degrees, and four training strategies, all based on the state of the art backbone Self-Distillation with No Labels (DINO)v2. Our results reveal a pronounced retrieval bias in favor of models trained on original data, which produce the most similar retrievals after anonymization. The findings of this paper offer practical insights for developing privacy-compliant CBIR systems while preserving performance."}

We introduce Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construc- tion combining a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) front-end with a diagonal phase-only embedding aligned with the geometry of diagonal quantum maps. Within a unified framework, we compare QK-DFT against alternative quantum variants (QK-PCA, QK-RP) and classi- cal SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection, quantifying robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically sup- ported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared to classical baselines, QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware exper- iments confirm that SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation. These results indicate that robustness in quan- tum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning."}

In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems."}

Furthermore, PaReGTA is model-agnostic and can benefit from future EHR-specialized sentence-embedding models. For interpretability, we introduce PaReGTA-RSS (Representation Shift Score), which quantifies clinically defined factor importance by recomputing representations after targeted factor removal and projecting representation shifts through a machine learning model.

A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K.

We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule.

However, training under this paradigm presents its own challenge: the extrapolation error stemming from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methodologies have endeavored to address this issue through means like penalizing OOD Q-values or imposing similarity constraints on the learned policy and the behavior policy. Nonetheless, these approaches are often beset by limitations such as being overly conservative in utilizing OOD data, imprecise OOD data characterization, and significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Q Network framework. The framework aims to enhance Offline Reinforcement Learning by fully leveraging the potential of OOD data while still ensuring efficiency in the learning process. Specifically, the framework quantifies data uncertainty and harnesses it in the training losses, aiming to train a policy that maximizes the lower confidence bound of the corresponding Q-function. Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \\TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance.

Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings.

Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \\textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods."}

However, the ill-posed nature of PDE inverse problems makes them highly sensitive to noise. Even a small fraction of corrupted observations can distort internal neural representations, severely impairing accuracy and destabilizing training. Motivated by recent advances in machine unlearning and structured network pruning, we propose P-PINN, a selective pruning framework designed to unlearn the influence of corrupted data in a pretrained PINN. Specifically, starting from a PINN trained on the full dataset, P-PINN evaluates a joint residual--data fidelity indicator, a weighted combination of data misfit and PDE residuals, to partition the training set into reliable and corrupted subsets. Next, we introduce a bias-based neuron importance measure that quantifies directional activation discrepancies between the two subsets, identifying neurons whose representations are predominantly driven by corrupted samples. Building on this, an iterative pruning strategy then removes noise-sensitive neurons layer by layer. The resulting pruned network is fine-tuned on the reliable data subject to the original PDE constraints, acting as a lightweight post-processing stage rather than a complete retraining. Numerical experiments on extensive PDE inverse-problem benchmarks demonstrate that P-PINN substantially improves robustness, accuracy, and training stability under noisy conditions, achieving up to a 96.6\\% reduction in relative error compared with baseline PINNs. These results indicate that activation-level post hoc pruning is a promising mechanism for enhancing the reliability of physics-informed learning in noise-contaminated settings."}

In this work, we investigate the distinct emergent mechanisms that arise when training AR versus Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, such as Discrete Diffusion Models (dLLMs), on lookahead tasks. By requiring the models to plan ahead to reach the correct conclusion, we analyze how these two paradigms fundamentally differ in their approach to the problem. We identify a critical asymmetry in planning problems: while forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching junctions, reverse generation is often deterministic. This asymmetry creates an opportunity for NAR models. Through mechanistic analysis of training and inference dynamics, we demonstrate that NAR models learn to solve planning tasks by utilizing future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding the need to learn complex traversal mechanisms entirely. Consequently, we report that both AR and NAR models are able to achieve perfect accuracy on the lookahead task. However, NAR models require exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures compared to AR models, which often fail to converge without specific curriculum adjustments."}

However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes."}

Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100. Overall, our results demonstrate analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting an important role for the relative scale of initialization across different layers in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning."}

BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety.

We study this effect under the name Asymptotic Semantic Collapse in Hierarchical Optimization. In a closed linguistic setting with a Dominant Anchor Node whose semantic state has effectively infinite inertia, we show that repeated interactions with Peripheral Agent Nodes drive an asymptotic alignment that minimizes a global loss. We model semantic states as points on a Riemannian manifold and analyze the induced projection dynamics. Two consequences follow. First, the limiting semantic configuration is insensitive to the optimization history: both smooth gradient-style updates and stochastic noisy updates converge to the same topological endpoint, establishing path independence at convergence. Second, the degree of context dependence controls information content: moving from atomic (independent) representations to fully entangled (context-bound) representations forces the node entropy, interpreted as available degrees of freedom, to vanish in the limit. The theory connects information-theoretic quantities with differential-geometric structure and suggests an interpretation as an immutable consensus rule that constrains agents to a shared semantic grammar. A lightweight dataset-free benchmark on an RWKV-7 13B GGUF checkpoint complements the analysis, reporting zero hash collisions, mean compliance of 0.50 under greedy decoding and 0.531 under stochastic decoding, and final Jaccard-to-anchor similarity values of 0.295 and 0.224, respectively."}

Unlike other clinical domains, such as electronic health records, radiological images, and biosignals, where numerous question-answering (QA) datasets and models have been established, audio-based modalities remain notably underdeveloped.\n  We curated and harmonized data from 11 diverse respiratory audio datasets to construct the first Respiratory Audio Question Answering (RA-QA) dataset.

This new data resource contains about 7.5 million QA pairs spanning more than 60 attributes and three question types: single verification, multiple choice, and open-ended questions. Building upon this dataset, we introduce a novel benchmark that compares audio-text generation models with traditional audio classifiers to evaluate their respective performance.\\\\Our experiments reveal interesting performance variations across different attributes and question types, establishing a baseline and paving the way for more advanced architectures that could further improve the performance.

Conventional physics-based energy functions are often computationally expensive, limiting their utility in large-scale screening. In contrast, deep learning-based scoring models offer improved computational efficiency but frequently suffer from limited cross-target generalization and poor interpretability, which restrict their practical applicability. Here we present BioLM-Score, a simple yet generalizable protein-ligand scoring model that couples geometric modeling with representation learning. Specifically, it employs modality-specific and structure-aware encoders for proteins and ligands, each augmented with biomolecular language models to enrich structural and chemical representations. Subsequently, these representations are integrated through a mixture density network to predict multimodal interatomic distance distributions, from which statistically grounded likelihood-based scores are derived. Evaluations on the CASF-2016 benchmark demonstrate that BioLM-Score achieves significant improvements across docking, scoring, ranking, and screening tasks. Moreover, the proposed scoring function serves as an effective optimization objective for guiding docking protocols and conformational search. In summary, BioLM-Score provides a principled and practical alternative to existing scoring functions, combining efficiency, generalization, and interpretability for structure-based drug discovery."}

In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable."}

We show that tabular ICL can be extended to relational prediction with a simple recipe: automatically featurize each target row using relational aggregations over its linked records, materialize the resulting augmented table, and run an off-the-shelf tabular foundation model on it. We package this approach in \\textit{RDBLearn} (https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn), an easy-to-use toolkit with a scikit-learn-style estimator interface that makes it straightforward to swap different tabular ICL backends; a complementary agent-specific interface is provided as well.

Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency."}

We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95).

Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning.

However, it is well-known that such models are susceptible to hallucinations: they may insert features into the reconstructed image which are not actually present in the original image. In a medical setting, such hallucinations may endanger patient health as they can lead to incorrect diagnoses. In this work, we aim to quantify the extent to which state-of-the-art generative models suffer from hallucinations in the context of magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Specifically, we craft adversarial perturbations resembling random noise for the unprocessed input images which induce hallucinations when reconstructed using a generative model. We perform this evaluation on the brain and knee images from the fastMRI data set using UNet and end-to-end VarNet architectures to reconstruct the images. Our results show that these models are highly susceptible to small perturbations and can be easily coaxed into producing hallucinations. This fragility may partially explain why hallucinations occur in the first place and suggests that a carefully constructed adversarial training routine may reduce their prevalence. Moreover, these hallucinations cannot be reliably detected using traditional image quality metrics. Novel approaches will therefore need to be developed to detect when hallucinations have occurred."}

However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents.

Each correction offers information on what the robot should and should not do, where the corrected behavior is more aligned with task objectives than the original behavior. Most prior work on learning from corrections involves interpreting a correction as a new demonstration (consisting of the modified robot behavior), or a preference (for the modified trajectory compared to the robot's original behavior). However, this overlooks one essential element of the correction feedback, which is the human's decision to intervene in the robot's behavior in the first place. This decision can be influenced by multiple factors including the robot's task progress, alignment with human expectations, dynamics, motion legibility, and optimality. In this work, we investigate whether the timing of this decision can offer a useful signal for inferring these task-relevant influences. In particular, we investigate three potential applications for this learning signal: (1) identifying features of a robot's motion that may prompt people to correct it, (2) quickly inferring the final goal of a human's correction based on the timing and initial direction of their correction motion, and (3) learning more precise constraints for task objectives. Our results indicate that correction timing results in improved learning for the first two of these applications.

In this paper, we consider three transmission scheduling problems with energy constraints, where such information is needed, and yet must remain private: minimizing total transmission time when (i) fixed-power or (ii) fixed-rate time slotting with power control is used, and (iii) maximizing the amount of data uploaded in a fixed time period. Using a real-time federated optimization framework, we show how the scheduler can iteratively interact only with the DTs to produce global fractional solutions to these problems, without the latter revealing their private information.

Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in autonomous endovascular navigation, but generalization across 'long' navigation tasks remains challenging. We propose a Hierarchical Modular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HM-MARL) framework for autonomous two-device navigation in vitro, enabling efficient and generalizable navigation. HM-MARL was developed to autonomously navigate a guide catheter and guidewire from the femoral artery to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A modular multi-agent approach was used to decompose the complex navigation task into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. The framework was validated in both in silico and in vitro testbeds to assess generalization and real-world feasibility. In silico, a single-vasculature model achieved 92-100% success rates on individual anatomies, while a multi-vasculature model achieved 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies. In vitro, both HM-MARL models successfully navigated 100% of trials from the femoral artery to the right common carotid artery and 80% to the right ICA but failed on the left-side vessel superhuman challenge due to the anatomy and catheter type used in navigation. This study presents the first demonstration of in vitro autonomous navigation in MT vasculature. While HM-MARL enables generalization across anatomies, the simulation-to-real transition introduces challenges. Future work will refine RL strategies using world models and validate performance on unseen in vitro data, advancing autonomous MT towards clinical translation."}

Unfortunately, heterogeneous antenna hardware with varying dimensions, orientations, codebooks, element patterns, and polarization angles limits their feasibility and generalization. This challenge requires either a heterogeneity-agnostic model functional under these variations, or developing many models for each configuration, which is infeasible and expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a unifying AI/ML-based beam selection algorithm supporting antenna heterogeneity by predicting wireless propagation characteristics independent of antenna configuration. We derive a reference signal received power (RSRP) model that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration. We propose an optimization framework to extract propagation variables consisting of angle-of-arrival (AoA), angle-of-departure (AoD), and a matrix incorporating path gain and channel depolarization from beamformed RSRP measurements. We develop a three-stage autoregressive network to predict these variables from user location, enabling RSRP calculation and beam selection for arbitrary antenna configurations without retraining or having a separate model for each configuration. Simulation results show our heterogeneity-agnostic method provides spectral efficiency close to that of genie-aided selection both with and without antenna heterogeneity."}

Machine learning world models compress visual input into latent spaces, discarding the spatial structure that characterizes sensory cortex. We propose isomorphic world models: architectures preserving sensory topology so that physics prediction becomes geometric propagation rather than abstract state transition. We implement this using neural fields with motor-gated channels, where activity evolves through local lateral connectivity and motor commands multiplicatively modulate specific populations. Three experiments support this approach: (1) local connectivity is sufficient to learn ballistic physics, with predictions traversing intermediate locations rather than \"teleporting\"; (2) policies trained entirely in imagination transfer to real physics at nearly twice the rate of latent-space alternatives; and (3) motor-gated channels spontaneously develop body-selective encoding through visuomotor prediction alone. These findings suggest intuitive physics and body schema may share a common origin in spatially structured neural dynamics."}

Past ``many-analyst\" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \\emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs."}

Although diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables detailed mapping of these pathways through tractography, how white matter pathways directly facilitate large-scale neural synchronisation remains poorly understood. We developed a data-driven framework that integrates dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) to model the dynamic coupling supported by white matter tracks. Specifically, we employed track dynamic functional connectivity (Track-DFC) to characterise functional coupling of remote grey matter connected by individual white matter tracks. Using independent component analysis followed by k-medoids clustering, we derived functionally-coherent clusters of white matter tracks from the Human Connectome Project young adult cohort. When applied to the HCP ageing cohort, these clusters exhibited widespread age-related declines in both functional coupling strength and temporal variability. Importantly, specific clusters encompassing pathways linking control, default mode, attention, and visual systems significantly mediated the relationship between age and cognitive performance. Together, these findings depict the functional organisation of white matter tracks and provide a powerful tool to study brain ageing and cognitive decline."}

For example, Wasserstein VI (WVI) and black-box VI (BBVI) perform gradient descent in measure space (Bures-Wasserstein space) and parameter space, respectively. Previously, for the Gaussian variational family, convergence guarantees for WVI have shown superiority over existing results for black-box VI with the reparametrization gradient, suggesting the measure space approach might provide some unique benefits. In this work, however, we close this gap by obtaining identical state-of-the-art iteration complexity guarantees for both. In particular, we identify that WVI's superiority stems from the specific gradient estimator it uses, which BBVI can also leverage with minor modifications. The estimator in question is usually associated with Price's theorem and utilizes second-order information (Hessians) of the target log-density. We will refer to this as Price's gradient. On the flip side, WVI can be made more widely applicable by using the reparametrization gradient, which requires only gradients of the log-density. We empirically demonstrate that the use of Price's gradient is the major source of performance improvement."}

WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle'' that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. Guided by this oracle, WiCompass employs a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples. Experiments show that WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies. By shifting focus from brute-force scaling to coverage-aware data acquisition, this work offers a practical path toward robust mmWave sensing."}

Spatiotemporal mismatches between stochastic task arrivals and intermittent green energy along with complex inter-user interference in multi-antenna (MIMO) uplinks complicate real-time resource management. Traditional centralized optimization and off-policy reinforcement learning struggle with scalability and signaling overhead in dense networks. This paper proposes CADDTO-PPO, a carbon-aware decentralized dynamic task offloading framework based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization. The multi-user MIMO-MEC system is modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) to jointly minimize carbon emissions and buffer latency and energy wastage. A scalable architecture utilizes decentralized execution with parameter sharing (DEPS), which enables autonomous IoT agents to make fine-grained power control and offloading decisions based solely on local observations. Additionally, a carbon-first reward structure adaptively prioritizes green time slots for data transmission to decouple system throughput from grid-dependent carbon footprints. Finally, experimental results demonstrate CADDTO-PPO outperforms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and lyapunov-based baselines. The framework achieves the lowest carbon intensity and maintains near-zero packet overflow rates under extreme traffic loads. Architectural profiling validates the framework to demonstrate a constant $O(1)$ inference complexity and theoretical lightweight feasibility for future generation sustainable IoT deployments."}

However, existing techniques for evaluating this robustness are unsuitable for code generation because the input data space of natural language descriptions is discrete. To address this problem, we propose a robustness evaluation method called scenario domain analysis, which aims to find the expected minimal change in the natural language descriptions of coding tasks that would cause the LLMs to produce incorrect outputs. We have formally proved the theoretical properties of the method and also conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art art LLMs: Gemini-pro, Codex, Llamma2 and Falcon 7B, and have found that we are able to rank these with confidence from best to worst.

To address this, we introduce the Productivity-Reliability Plane (PRP), which evaluates performance through Tasks per Hour (TPH) and Mean Time Between Intervention (MTBI) under a continuous-run protocol that demands both high-speed execution and sustained robustness. Habilis-$β$ achieves high performance by integrating language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for robust interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations that capture state drift across consecutive task iterations. The system further employs ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping to accelerate free-space transit, utilizes rectified-flow distillation to enable high-frequency control on edge devices, and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a deployment-time knob to dynamically balance instruction adherence and learned interaction priors. In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations, Habilis-$β$ achieves strong performance under the PRP metrics, compared to $π_{0.5}$ in both simulation and real-world environments.

For the squared Wasserstein distance, we prove an ANOVA-style decomposition that separates (i) selection-induced mixture effects from (ii) cross-silo heterogeneity, yielding tight bounds linking local and global metrics.

The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty.

Using a personal lending dataset from LendingClub, we evaluate three commercial LLMs, including GPT-4-turbo, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Results provide strong evidence for the translator role. In contrast, autonomous explanations show low alignment with model-based attributions. Few-shot prompting improves feature overlap for logistic regression but does not consistently benefit XGBoost, suggesting that LLMs have limited capacity to recover non-linear, interaction-driven reasoning from prompt cues alone. Our findings position LLMs as effective narrative interfaces grounded in auditable model attributions, rather than as substitutes for post-hoc explainers in credit risk model governance. Practitioners should leverage LLMs to bridge the communication gap between complex model outputs and regulatory or business stakeholders, while preserving the rigor and traceability required by credit risk governance frameworks."}

We further demonstrate that the scale of these phonological vectors correlate to the degree of acoustic realization of their corresponding phonological features in a continuous manner. For example, the difference between [d] and [t] yields a voicing vector: adding this vector to [p] produces [b], while scaling it results in a continuum of voicing.

Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization.

We argue that many such failures are reliability failures caused by stochastic drift from a task's latent solution structure, not capability failures. Every well-defined tool-use task imposes a canonical solution path (i.e., a convergent set of tool invocations shared across successful runs) and agent success depends critically on whether a trajectory stays within this path's operating envelope. We establish this causally using a natural experiment that holds model capability and task difficulty fixed by construction. We analyze trajectories from the Toolathlon benchmark: 22 frontier models each attempt 108 real-world tool-use tasks across 3 independent runs, yielding 515 model$\\times$task units where the same model succeeds on some runs and fails on others due to LLM sampling stochasticity alone. Within these units, successful runs adhere significantly more closely to the canonical solution path than failed runs ($+$0.060 Jaccard, $p<0.0001$, $n=488$ units, 95% CI [+0.043, +0.077]). This result survives six robustness checks including cross-model-family leave-one-out validation. Critically, the causal mechanism is gradual and self-reinforcing: the adherence gap is statistically indistinguishable from zero through the first 50% of the trajectory, ruling out early-branching selection bias, and each off-canonical tool call raises the probability that the next call is also off-canonical by 22.7 percentage points ($\\hatβ=+0.227$, $p<0.0001$), more than doubling the baseline rate. These findings imply that agent reliability cannot be improved by capability scaling alone, but offer a highly actionable intervention: a simple monitor that restarts the bottom tercile of runs based on mid-trajectory canonical adherence lifts success rates by $+$8.8 percentage points among intervened runs."}

Second, even sophisticated technical advances remain within the regime of Gestell (Enframing), improving calculation without questioning the primacy of calculation itself. Third, AI's lack of existential structure, specifically the absence of Care (Sorge), is genuinely explanatory: it illuminates why AI systems have no internal resources for questioning their own optimization imperatives, and why they optimize without the anxiety (Angst) that signals, in human agents, the friction between calculative absorption and authentic existence. We conclude by exploring the pedagogical value of this perspective, arguing that data science education should cultivate not only technical competence but ontological literacy--the capacity to recognize what worldviews our tools enact and when calculation itself may be the wrong mode of engagement."}

To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field.

Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap."}

To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit.

Yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for various flight manoeuvres are important for understanding how agile flight can be accomplished. Even in a simple flight, multiple objectives are at play, complicating analysis of the overall flight mechanism. Using the data-driven method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) on motion capture recordings of hawks, we show that multiple behavioral states such as flapping, turning, landing, and gliding, can be modeled by simple and interpretable modal structures (i.e. the underlying wing-tail shape) which can be linearly combined to reproduce the experimental flight observations. Moreover, the DMD model can be used to extrapolate naturalistic flapping. Flight is highly individual, with differences in style across the hawks, but we find they share a common set of dynamic modes. The DMD model is a direct fit to data, unlike traditional models constructed from physics principles which can rarely be tested on real data and whose assumptions are typically invalid in real flight. The DMD approach gives a highly accurate reconstruction of the flight dynamics with only three parameters needed to characterize flapping, and a fourth to integrate turning manoeuvres. The DMD analysis further shows that the underlying mechanism of flight, much like simplest walking models, displays a parametric coupling between dominant modes suggesting efficiency for locomotion."}

We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis.

In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size.

To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations.

Over-The-Air (OTA) computation is regarded as an emerging transformative approach assigning the wireless channel to actively perform computational tasks. This article introduces the concept of Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Networks (MINNs), a physical-layer-enabled deep learning framework that leverages programmable multi-layer metasurface structures and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels to realize computational layers in the wave propagation domain. The MINN system is conceptualized as three modules: Encoder, Channel (uncontrollable propagation features and metasurfaces), and Decoder. The first and last modules, realized respectively at the multi-antenna transmitter and receiver, consist of conventional digital or purposely designed analog Deep Neural Network (DNN) layers, and the metasurfaces responses of the Channel module are optimized alongside all modules as trainable weights. This architecture enables computation offloading into the end-to-end physical layer, flexibly among its constituent modules, achieving performance comparable to fully digital DNNs while significantly reducing power consumption. The training of the MINN framework, two representative variations, and performance results for indicative applications are presented, highlighting the potential of MINNs as a lightweight and sustainable solution for future EI-enabled wireless systems. The article is concluded with a list of open challenges and promising research directions."}

Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning."}

The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines.

Although many studies have documented spatial patterns of forest degradation, there is limited understanding of the dynamic elasticity linking tree cover loss to carbon emissions at subnational scales. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive panel dataset of annual forest loss and carbon emission estimates for U.S. subnational administrative units from 2001 to 2023, based on the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset. We apply fixed effects and dynamic panel regression techniques to isolate within-region variation and account for temporal persistence in emissions. Our results show that forest loss has a significant positive short-run elasticity with carbon emissions, and that emissions exhibit strong persistence over time. Importantly, the estimated long-run elasticity, accounting for autoregressive dynamics, is substantially larger than the short-run effect, indicating cumulative impacts of repeated forest loss events. These findings highlight the importance of modeling temporal dynamics when assessing environmental responses to land cover change. The dynamic elasticity framework proposed here offers a robust and interpretable tool for analyzing environmental change processes, and can inform both regional monitoring systems and carbon accounting frameworks."}

When sensing is limited to external cameras, the problem is further compounded by perception noise and the absence of direct force or state measurements. We present Vid2Sid, a video-driven system identification pipeline that couples foundation-model perception with a VLM-in-the-loop optimizer that analyzes paired sim-real videos, diagnoses concrete mismatches, and proposes physics parameter updates with natural language rationales. We evaluate our approach on a tendon-actuated finger (rigid-body dynamics in MuJoCo) and a deformable continuum tentacle (soft-body dynamics in PyElastica). On sim2real holdout controls unseen during training, Vid2Sid achieves the best average rank across all settings, matching or exceeding black-box optimizers while uniquely providing interpretable reasoning at each iteration. Sim2sim validation confirms that Vid2Sid recovers ground-truth parameters most accurately (mean relative error under 13\\% vs. 28--98\\%), and ablation analysis reveals three calibration regimes. VLM-guided optimization excels when perception is clean and the simulator is expressive, while model-class limitations bound performance in more challenging settings."}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a general perceive-reason-act framework for this goal. However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary. Extensive experiments on diverse, unseen multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate a 24.6% improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing inference time by 56.5%."}

In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism.

Our approach combines local many-body geometric features with a non-self-consistent field formalism that updates learnable charge and spin densities through polarisable iterations to model induction, followed by global charge equilibration via learnable Fukui functions to control total charge and total spin. This design enables an accurate and physical description of systems with varying charge and spin states while maintaining computational efficiency.

Notably, we demonstrate that the inclusion of long-range electrostatics leads to a large improvement in the description of non-covalent interactions and supramolecular complexes over non-electrostatic models, including sub-kcal/mol prediction of molecular crystal formation energy in the X23-DMC dataset and a fourfold improvement over short-ranged models on protein-ligand interactions.

Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.\n  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.\n  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks.

Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions.

Prior work has proposed information gain and Thompson sampling based myopic, greedy approaches for agents to actively decide query or search locations when the number of targets is unknown. Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams. Our proposed algorithm outperforms standard baselines in offline reinforcement learning in terms of full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making."}

We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection."}

GOIMDA selects inputs by maximizing their expected influence on a user-specified goal functional, such as test loss, predictive entropy, or the value of an optimizer-recommended design. Leveraging first-order influence functions, we derive a tractable acquisition rule that combines the goal gradient, training-loss curvature, and candidate sensitivity to model parameters. We show theoretically that, for generalized linear models, GOIMDA approximates predictive-entropy minimization up to a correction term accounting for goal alignment and prediction bias, thereby, yielding uncertainty-aware behavior without maintaining a Bayesian posterior. Empirically, across learning tasks (including image and text classification) and optimization tasks (including noisy global optimization benchmarks and neural-network hyperparameter tuning), GOIMDA consistently reaches target performance with substantially fewer labeled samples or function evaluations than uncertainty-based active learning and Gaussian-process Bayesian optimization baselines."}

We propose MAGT (Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport), a flow-like generator that learns a one-shot, manifold-aligned transport from a low-dimensional base distribution to the data space. Training is performed at a fixed Gaussian smoothing level, where the score is well-defined and numerically stable. We approximate this fixed-level score using a finite set of latent anchor points with self-normalized importance sampling, yielding a tractable objective. MAGT samples in a single forward pass, concentrates probability near the learned support, and induces an intrinsic density with respect to the manifold volume measure, enabling principled likelihood evaluation for generated samples.

In this framework, measurement models are learned implicitly by minimizing a denoising score matching objective. At inference, the learned denoiser is used alongside a (learned) dynamics model to approximately solve the Bayesian filtering equation at each time step, effectively guiding predicted states toward the data manifold informed by measurements.

We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively.

In this work, we characterize both approximation and statistical properties of neural networks with smooth activations over the Sobolev space $W^{s,\\infty}([0,1]^d)$ for arbitrary smoothness $s>0$. We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors). In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size. This complexity control ensures statistical learnability under empirical risk minimization (ERM) and removes the impractical sparsity constraints commonly required in prior analyses."}

For these patients, serial biomarker measurements (e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels) are routinely collected to inform treating physicians of the risk of liver failure and guide clinical decision-making. Two popular statistical approaches to derive dynamic predictions are joint modelling and landmarking. However, recently, machine learning techniques have also been proposed. Each approach has its merits, and no single method exists to outperform all others. Consequently, obtaining the best possible survival estimates is challenging. Therefore, we extend the Super Learner framework to combine dynamic predictions from different models and procedures. Super Learner is an ensemble learning technique that allows users to combine different prediction algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and flexibility. It uses cross-validation and different objective functions of performance (e.g., squared loss) that suit specific applications to build the optimally weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. In our work, we pay special attention to appropriate objective functions for Super Learner to obtain the most optimal weighted combination of dynamic predictions. In our primary biliary cholangitis application, Super Learner presented unique benefits due to its ability to flexibly combine outputs from a diverse set of models with varying assumptions for equal or better predictive performance than any model fit separately."}

DSMR is trained in a single left-to-right pass over each complete composition, akin to how a musician experiences it from beginning to end, while carrying recurrent cross-segment states forward. Within this recurrent framework, we systematically study how depth-wise horizon allocations affect optimization, best-checkpoint perplexity, and efficiency. By allocating different history-window lengths across layers while keeping the total recurrent-state budget fixed, DSMR creates depth-dependent temporal receptive fields within a recurrent attention stack without reducing compute depth. Our main instantiation is a two-scale DSMR schedule that allocates long history windows to lower layers and a uniform short window to the remaining layers. Experiments on the piano performance dataset MAESTRO demonstrate that two-scale DSMR provides a practical quality--efficiency recipe for full-length long-context symbolic music modeling with recurrent attention under limited computational resources."}

Uplift measures the pure incremental causal effect of an intervention (e.g., sending a coupon or a marketing message) on user behavior, modeled as a conditional individual treatment effect. Many real-world interventions are combinatorial: a treatment is a policy that specifies context-dependent action distributions rather than a single atomic label. Although recent work considers structured treatments, most methods rely on categorical or opaque encodings, limiting robustness and generalization to rare or newly deployed policies. We propose an uplift estimation framework that aligns treatment representation with causal semantics. Each policy is represented by the mixture it induces over contextaction components and embedded via a permutation-invariant aggregation. This representation is integrated into an orthogonalized low-rank uplift model, extending Robinson-style decompositions to learned, vector-valued treatments. We show that the resulting estimator is expressive for policy-induced causal effects, orthogonally robust to nuisance estimation errors, and stable under small policy perturbations.

Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide some alleviation of these limitations, but have problems of their own. The key step of specifying prior distributions in BNNs is no trivial task, yet is often skipped out of convenience. In this work, we propose a new class of prior distributions for BNNs, the Dirichlet scale mixture (DSM) prior, that addresses current limitations in Bayesian neural networks through structured, sparsity-inducing shrinkage. Theoretically, we derive general dependence structures and shrinkage results for DSM priors and show how they manifest under the geometry induced by neural networks. In experiments on simulated and real world data we find that the DSM priors encourages sparse networks through implicit feature selection, show robustness under adversarial attacks and deliver competitive predictive performance with substantially fewer effective parameters. In particular, their advantages appear most pronounced in correlated, moderately small data regimes, and are more amenable to weight pruning. Moreover, by adopting heavy-tailed shrinkage mechanisms, our approach aligns with recent findings that such priors can mitigate the cold posterior effect, offering a principled alternative to the commonly used Gaussian priors."}

A more intuitive approach is to select samples with similar disease severity characteristics, since these samples are more likely to have similar structures related to the progression of a disease. To enable this, we introduce a method that generates disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans on the basis of gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels are used to train a supervised contrastive learning setup to improve biomarker classification accuracy by as much as 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy."}

In response, private inference (PI) protocols have been created to allow parties to perform inference without revealing their sensitive data. Despite recent advances in the efficiency of PI, most current methods assume a semi-honest threat model where the data owner is honest and adheres to the protocol. However, in reality, data owners can have different motivations and act in unpredictable ways, making this assumption unrealistic. To demonstrate how a malicious client can compromise the semi-honest model, we first designed an inference manipulation attack against a range of state-of-the-art private inference protocols. This attack allows a malicious client to modify the model output with 3x to 8x fewer queries than current black-box attacks. Motivated by the attacks, we proposed and implemented RobPI, a robust and resilient private inference protocol that withstands malicious clients. RobPI integrates a distinctive cryptographic protocol that bolsters security by weaving encryption-compatible noise into the logits and features of private inference, thereby efficiently warding off malicious-client attacks. Our extensive experiments on various neural networks and datasets show that RobPI achieves ~91.9% attack success rate reduction and increases more than 10x the number of queries required by malicious-client attacks."}

These limitations have motivated growing interest in using textual information as the primary source of trading signals in learning-based systems. Two key challenges hinder existing approaches: (1) the absence of large-scale, event-centric datasets that jointly model news semantics and statistically grounded market reactions, and (2) the misalignment between language model reasoning and financially valid trading behavior under dynamic market conditions. To address these challenges, we propose Janus-Q, an end-to-end event-driven trading framework that elevates financial news events from auxiliary signals to primary decision units. Janus-Q unifies event-centric data construction and model optimization under a two-stage paradigm. Stage I focuses on event-centric data construction, building a large-scale financial news event dataset comprising 62,400 articles annotated with 10 fine-grained event types, associated stocks, sentiment labels, and event-driven cumulative abnormal return (CAR). Stage II performs decision-oriented fine-tuning, combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning guided by a Hierarchical Gated Reward Model (HGRM), which explicitly captures trade-offs among multiple trading objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Janus-Q achieves more consistent, interpretable, and profitable trading decisions than market indices and LLM baselines, improving the Sharpe Ratio by up to 102.0% while increasing direction accuracy by over 17.5% compared to the strongest competing strategies."}

This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution. Agents that embed adaptability at the core of imitation learning thus have an essential capability for operating in an open-ended world."}

The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance."}

In industrial recommender systems, features play vital roles as they carry information for downstream models. Accurate feature importance estimation is critical because it helps identify the most useful feature subsets from thousands of feature candidates for online services. Such selection enables improved online performance while reducing computational cost. To address feature selection problems in deep learning, trainable gate-based and sensitivity-based methods have been proposed and proven effective in industrial practice. However, through the analysis of real-world cases, we identified three bias issues that cause feature importance estimation to rely on partial model layers, samples, or gradients, ultimately leading to inaccurate importance estimation. We refer to these as layer bias, baseline bias, and approximation bias. To mitigate these issues, we propose FairFS, a fair and accurate feature selection algorithm. FairFS regularizes feature importance estimated across all nonlinear transformation layers to address layer bias. It also introduces a smooth baseline feature close to the classifier decision boundary and adopts an aggregated approximation method to alleviate baseline and approximation biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairFS effectively mitigates these biases and achieves state-of-the-art feature selection performance."}

While the model denies injection in sampled outputs, logit lens analysis reveals clear detection signals in the residual stream, which are attenuated in the final layers. Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety."}

This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality. Our method enhances alignment between radiology images and clinical text, improving cross-modal retrieval and image captioning."}

This challenge has led to OOD detection methods that aim to identify and reject unreliable predictions. Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI. Our findings highlight an overlooked failure mode in OOD detection and provide guidance for more robust detectors.

In the policy gradient setting, per-agent gradient estimate variance scales as $Θ(N)$, yielding sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N/ε)$. We observe that many domains -- cloud computing, transportation, power systems -- have differentiable analytical models that prescribe efficient system states. In this work, we propose Descent-Guided Policy Gradient (DG-PG), a framework that constructs noise-free per-agent guidance gradients from these analytical models, decoupling each agent's gradient from the actions of all others. We prove that DG-PG reduces gradient variance from $Θ(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, preserves the equilibria of the cooperative game, and achieves agent-independent sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$. On a heterogeneous cloud scheduling task with up to 200 agents, DG-PG converges within 10 episodes at every tested scale -- from $N=5$ to $N=200$ -- directly confirming the predicted scale-invariant complexity, while MAPPO and IPPO fail to converge under identical architectures."}

Human-Centered Ensembles for Adaptive Human-AI Collaboration", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.HC", "cs.LG"], "comment": "AAAI 2026", "summary": "In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance."}

Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a \"black box\" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts.

Preliminary version of an ongoing project that will be expanded with furhter evaluations", "summary": "We study post-calibration uncertainty for trained ensembles of classifiers. Specifically, we consider both aleatoric (label noise) and epistemic (model) uncertainty. Among the most popular and widely used calibration methods in classification are temperature scaling (i.e., pool-then-calibrate) and conformal methods. However, the main shortcoming of these calibration methods is that they do not balance the proportion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Not balancing these uncertainties can severely misrepresent predictive uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions in some input regions while being underconfident in others. To address this shortcoming, we present a simple but powerful calibration algorithm Joint Uncertainty Calibration (JUCAL) that jointly calibrates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. JUCAL jointly calibrates two constants to weight and scale epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by optimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) on the validation/calibration dataset. JUCAL can be applied to any trained ensemble of classifiers (e.g., transformers, CNNs, or tree-based methods), with minimal computational overhead, without requiring access to the models' internal parameters. We experimentally evaluate JUCAL on various text classification tasks, for ensembles of varying sizes and with different ensembling strategies. Our experiments show that JUCAL significantly outperforms SOTA calibration methods across all considered classification tasks, reducing NLL and predictive set size by up to 15% and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, even applying JUCAL to an ensemble of size 5 can outperform temperature-scaled ensembles of size up to 50 in terms of NLL and predictive set size, resulting in up to 10 times smaller inference costs. Thus, we propose JUCAL as a new go-to method for calibrating ensembles in classification."}
