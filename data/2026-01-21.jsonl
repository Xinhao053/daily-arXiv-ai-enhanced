We deploy a state-of-the-art Large Language Model to evaluate the attractiveness of each Russell 1000 stock daily, starting from April 2025 when AI web interfaces enabled real-time search. Our data contribution is unique along three dimensions. First, the nowcasting framework is completely out-of-sample and free of look-ahead bias by construction: predictions are collected at the current edge of time, ensuring the AI has no knowledge of future outcomes. Second, this temporal design is irreproducible -- once the information environment passes, it can never be recreated. Third, our framework is 100% agentic: we do not feed the model news, disclosures, or curated text; it autonomously searches the web, filters sources, and synthesises information into quantitative predictions. We find that AI possesses genuine stock selection ability, but only for identifying top winners. Longing the 20 highest-ranked stocks generates a daily Fama-French five-factor plus momentum alpha of 18.4 basis points and an annualised Sharpe ratio of 2.43. Critically, these returns derive from an implementable strategy trading highly liquid Russell 1000 constituents, with transaction costs representing less than 10\\% of gross alpha. However, this predictability is highly concentrated: expanding beyond the top tier rapidly dilutes alpha, and bottom-ranked stocks exhibit returns statistically indistinguishable from the market. We hypothesise that this asymmetry reflects online information structure: genuinely positive news generates coherent signals, while negative news is contaminated by strategic corporate obfuscation and social media noise."}

Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\\\&A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

In such settings, surrogate models built from a limited set of simulations can substantially reduce the computational burden, provided that the design of computer experiments is enriched efficiently. In this context, we propose an active learning approach that, for a fixed evaluation budget, targets the most informative regions of the input space to improve sensitivity analysis accuracy. More specifically, our method builds on recent advances in active learning for sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures, DGSM) that exploit derivatives obtained from a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. By leveraging the joint posterior distribution of the GP gradient, we develop acquisition functions that better account for correlations between partial derivatives and their impact on the response surface, leading to a more comprehensive and robust methodology than existing DGSM-oriented criteria. The proposed approach is first compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark functions, and is then applied to a real environmental model of pesticide transfers."}

Recent score-matching approaches to SIVI (SIVI-SM) address this issue via a minimax formulation, at the expense of an additional lower-level optimization problem. In this paper, we propose kernel semi-implicit variational inference (KSIVI), a principled and tractable alternative that eliminates the lower-level optimization by leveraging kernel methods. We show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the lower-level problem admits an explicit solution, reducing the objective to the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD). Exploiting the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit distributions, the resulting KSD objective can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. We establish optimization guarantees via variance bounds on Monte Carlo gradient estimators and derive statistical generalization bounds of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts."}

Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters.

The main purpose of the present work is to describe a generic strategy for designing a tight approximation to the full conformal prediction region that can be efficiently computed. Along with this approximate confidence region, a theoretical quantification of the tightness of this approximation is developed, depending on the smoothness assumptions on the loss and score functions.

CAPQL, a preference-conditioned actor-critic method, achieves this by conditioning on weight vectors w and restricts data usage to the specific preferences under which it was collected, leaving off-policy data from other preferences unused. We introduce Hindsight Preference Replay (HPR), a simple and general replay augmentation strategy that retroactively relabels stored transitions with alternative preferences. This densifies supervision across the preference simplex without altering the CAPQL architecture or loss functions. Evaluated on six MO-Gymnasium locomotion tasks at a fixed 300000-step budget using expected utility (EUM), hypervolume (HV), and sparsity, HPR-CAPQL improves HV in five of six environments and EUM in four of six. On mo-humanoid-v5, for instance, EUM rises from $323\\!\\pm\\!125$ to $1613\\!\\pm\\!464$ and HV from 0.52M to 9.63M, with strong statistical support. mo-halfcheetah-v5 remains a challenging exception where CAPQL attains higher HV at comparable EUM.

The proposed approach extends applicability to a broader class of $f$-divergences than previously reported and yields theoretical results that recover previously known results. Additionally, the difference between the expected empirical risk of the ERM-$f$DR solution and that of its reference measure is characterized, providing insights into previously studied cases of $f$-divergences. A central contribution is the introduction of the normalization function, a mathematical object that is critical in both the dual formulation and practical computation of the ERM-$f$DR solution. This work presents an implicit characterization of the normalization function as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), establishes its key properties, and subsequently leverages them to construct a numerical algorithm for approximating the normalization factor under mild assumptions. Further analysis demonstrates structural equivalences between ERM-$f$DR problems with different $f$-divergences via transformations of the empirical risk. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to compute the training and test risks of ERM-$f$DR solutions under different $f$-divergence regularizers. This numerical example highlights the practical implications of choosing different functions $f$ in ERM-$f$DR problems."}

When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions. Finally, the practical effect of regularization is also demonstrated via simulation experiments."}

We address the crucial question of how to optimally allocate a fixed annotation budget between ground-truth labels and pairwise preferences in AI. Our solution, grounded in semi-parametric inference, casts the budget allocation problem as a monotone missing data framework. Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution. This work provides a principled and statistically efficient approach for budget-constrained learning in modern AI. Simulations and real-data analysis demonstrate the practical benefits and superior performance of our proposed method."}

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location.

Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D. We compare the models' performance across short-term (15 to 120 min) and long term (3 to more than 24 hours) prediction horizons (PHs).

The results show that 1) a PH of up to 1 hour provides the best results. 2) Conventional ML methods yield the best results for classification and DL for regression.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices. This separates invariant structure from modeling choice, enabling principled comparison and extension of attention mechanisms, and attention-based architectures."}

Probabilistic forecasts are needed to plan the inventory levels; the predictive distribution should cover non-negative values, have a mass in zero and a long upper tail. Intermittent time series are commonly forecast using local models, which are trained individually on each time series. In the last years global models, which are trained on a large collection of time series, have become popular for time series forecasting. Global models are often based on neural networks. However, they have not yet been exhaustively tested on intermittent time series. We carry out the first study comparing state-of-the-art local (iETS, TweedieGP) and global models (D-Linear, DeepAR, Transformers) on intermittent time series. For neural networks models we consider three different distribution heads suitable for intermittent time series: negative binomial, hurdle-shifted negative binomial and Tweedie. We use, for the first time, the last two distribution heads with neural networks. We perform experiments on five large datasets comprising more than 40'000 real-world time series. Among neural networks D-Linear provides best accuracy; it also consistently outperforms the local models. Moreover, it has also low computational requirements. Transformers-based architectures are instead much more computationally demanding and less accurate. Among the distribution heads, the Tweedie provides the best estimates of the highest quantiles, while the negative binomial offers overall the best performance."}

This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance. While maintaining the memory gains of Symmetric Attention, with minute overhead in terms of model parameters and computational overhead, the proposed model brings in enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and inference-time sampling. The proposed model is validated upon GPT2 base model and the results reflect the performance gains falling between plain Symmetric attention and GPT2 base model on a variety of GLUE benchmark tasks in terms of accuracy, with significant model size reduction with respect to the base model."}

Stability plays a crucial role in understanding generalization, robustness, and replicability, and a variety of stability notions have been proposed in different learning settings. However, while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning -- and indeed, it may be at odds with accuracy, since an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Thus, it is essential to understand the potential statistical cost of stability. In this work, we address this question by adopting a statistical decision-theoretic perspective, treating stability as a constraint in estimation. Focusing on two representative notions-worst-case stability and average-case stability-we first establish general lower bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy under each type of stability constraint. We then develop optimal stable estimators for four canonical estimation problems, including several mean estimation and regression settings. Together, these results characterize the optimal trade-offs between stability and accuracy across these tasks. Our findings formalize the intuition that average-case stability imposes a qualitatively weaker restriction than worst-case stability, and they further reveal that the gap between these two can vary substantially across different estimation problems."}

While scaling model size addresses complexity in broader AI, this approach yields diminishing returns for physics modeling. Drawing inspiration from Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian (HLE) numerical methods, we introduce deformable physics-aware recurrent convolutions (D-PARC) to overcome the rigidity of CNNs. Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data.

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces."}

However, justifying the validity of the instrument often poses a significant challenge. In this work, we highlight a problem generally neglected in arguments for instrumental variable validity: the presence of an ''aggregate treatment variable'', where the treatment (e.g., education, GDP, caloric intake) is composed of finer-grained components that each may have a different effect on the outcome. We show that the causal effect of an aggregate treatment is generally ambiguous, as it depends on how interventions on the aggregate are instantiated at the component level, formalized through the aggregate-constrained component intervention distribution. We then characterize conditions on the interventional distribution and the aggregate setting under which standard instrumental variable estimators identify the aggregate effect. The contrived nature of these conditions implies major limitations on the interpretation of instrumental variable estimates based on aggregate treatments and highlights the need for a broader justificatory base for the exclusion restriction in such settings."}

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity."}

Linear attention mechanisms offer linear or near-linear scaling yet often incur performance degradation. Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 ε^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $ε^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach. On three MovieLens datasets, our algorithm reduces bias by $88\\%$ relative to baseline estimators. We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data.

However, stemming from the batch-independence assumption during testing, which prevents the model from leveraging valuable knowledge accumulated from previous batches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time method called Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC), a test-time method that optimizes prototype estimation by leveraging information from previous query samples. IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol.

We further provide a statistical inference procedure by developing a new asymptotic theory for cross-validated prediction error. Finally, we apply this method to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments."}

We observe that pre-training on unlabeled jets leads to emergent semantic class clustering in the representation space. The clustering in the frozen embedding, when pre-trained on background jets only, enables anomaly detection via simple distance-based metrics, and the learned embedding can be fine-tuned for classification with improved performance compared to supervised models trained from scratch."}

Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \\tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.\n  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\\log(λ)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$. Given a spectral floor $r \\leq λ_{\\min}$, we obtain moment-constrained lower bounds, yielding a provable interval for $\\log\\det(A)$. A gap diagnostic indicates when to trust the point estimate and when to report bounds. All estimators and bounds cost $O(m)$, independent of $n$.

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $η_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($η_t < η_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($η_t > η_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment."}

In contrast with optimal transport maps which often have limited applicability in high dimensions, Schrodinger bridges can be solved using the celebrated Sinkhorn's algorithm, a.k.a. the iterative proportional fitting procedure. The stability properties of Sinkhorn bridges when the number of iterations tends to infinity is a very active research area in applied probability and machine learning. Traditional proofs of convergence are mainly based on nonlinear versions of Perron-Frobenius theory and related Hilbert projective metric techniques, gradient descent, Bregman divergence techniques and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, including propagation of convexity profiles based on coupling diffusions by reflection methods. The objective of this review article is to present, in a self-contained manner, recently developed Sinkhorn/Gibbs-type semigroup analysis based upon contraction coefficients and Lyapunov-type operator-theoretic techniques. These powerful, off-the-shelf semigroup methods are based upon transportation cost inequalities (e.g. log-Sobolev, Talagrand quadratic inequality, curvature estimates), $φ$-divergences, Kantorovich-type criteria and Dobrushin contraction-type coefficients on weighted Banach spaces as well as Wasserstein distances. This novel semigroup analysis allows one to unify and simplify many arguments in the stability of Sinkhorn algorithm. It also yields new contraction estimates w.r.t. generalized $φ$-entropies, as well as weighted total variation norms, Kantorovich criteria and Wasserstein distances."}

To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model.

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers.

We first construct MedCounterFact, a counterfactual medical QA dataset that requires the models to answer clinical comparison questions (i.e., judge the efficacy of certain treatments, with evidence consisting of randomized controlled trials provided as context). In MedCounterFact, real-world medical interventions within the questions and evidence are systematically replaced with four types of counterfactual stimuli, ranging from unknown words to toxic substances.

But what happens if the context does not align with model priors or safety protocols? In this paper, we investigate how LLMs behave and reason when presented with counterfactual or even adversarial medical evidence. We first construct MedCounterFact, a counterfactual medical QA dataset that requires the models to answer clinical comparison questions (i.e., judge the efficacy of certain treatments, with evidence consisting of randomized controlled trials provided as context). In MedCounterFact, real-world medical interventions within the questions and evidence are systematically replaced with four types of counterfactual stimuli, ranging from unknown words to toxic substances. Our evaluation across multiple frontier LLMs on MedCounterFact reveals that in the presence of counterfactual evidence, existing models overwhelmingly accept such \"evidence\" at face value even when it is dangerous or implausible, and provide confident and uncaveated answers.

We introduce MixFlow, a conditional flow-matching framework for descriptor-controlled generation that directly targets this limitation by jointly learning a descriptor-conditioned base distribution and a descriptor-conditioned flow field via shortest-path flow matching. By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization. We provide analytical insights into the behavior of the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple domains, including prediction of responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data and high-content microscopy-based drug screening tasks. Across these diverse settings, MixFlow consistently outperforms standard conditional flow-matching baselines. Overall, MixFlow offers a simple yet powerful approach for achieving robust, generalizable, and controllable generative modeling across heterogeneous domains."}

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

This issue arises frequently in traditional in-processing approaches such as fairness-through-regularization. In contrast, existing Pareto-efficient approaches are biased towards a certain perspective on fairness and fail to adapt to the broad range of fairness metrics studied in the literature. In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective. We equip our framework with two novel large-scale, single-loop algorithms, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD, and establish their convergence guarantees. We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of BADR over existing Pareto-efficient approaches to fairness."}

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond."}

Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations.

We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications.

This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_ρ$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_ρ$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern.

First, the unidirectional nature of decoder-only LLMs presents a fundamental architectural bottleneck for natural language understanding tasks that depend on rich, bidirectional context. Second, we confront the conventional reliance on Micro-F1 scores in event detection literature, which systematically inflates performance by favoring majority classes. Instead, we focus on Macro-F1 as a more representative measure of a model's ability across the long-tail of event types. Our experiments demonstrate that models enhanced with sentence context achieve superior performance over canonical decoder-only baselines.

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness."}

The short-term movements in these indices are closely intertwined with capital allocation decisions affecting research and development investment, drug availability, and long-term health outcomes. This research investigates whether historical open-high-low-close (OHLC) index data contain sufficient information for predicting the directional movement of the opening index on the subsequent trading day. The problem is formulated as a supervised classification task involving a one-step-ahead rolling window. A diverse feature set is constructed, comprising original prices, volatility-based technical indicators, and a novel class of nowcasting features derived from mutual OHLC ratios. The framework is evaluated on data from healthcare indices in the U.S. and Indian markets over a five-year period spanning multiple economic phases, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance, with accuracy exceeding 0.8 and Matthews correlation coefficients above 0.6. Notably, the proposed nowcasting features have emerged as a key determinant of the market movement. We have employed the Shapley-based explainability paradigm to further elucidate the contribution of the features: outcomes reveal the dominant role of the nowcasting features, followed by a more moderate contribution of original prices. This research offers a societal utility: the proposed features and model for short-term forecasting of healthcare indices can reduce information asymmetry and support a more stable and equitable health economy."}

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $Γ$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $φ$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $Γ$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $Γ$ to $NΓ$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(Γ)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $Ω(Γ)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $Γ=Θ(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $ν$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $Γ$."}

We show that TPBS models admit a closed-form expression for the Dirichlet energy, and reveal scenarios where perfect interpolation is possible with exponentially small Dirichlet energy. This renders global Dirichlet energy-based regularization ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization."}

Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines."}

Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance.

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks. However, the significant differences among downstream tasks often lead to performance degradation, especially under few-shot settings. Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions."}

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines."}

While it fails to alter the terminal learning phase in overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on high-dimensional datasets, empirical evidence consistently shows it offers significant benefits early in training. To transparently demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a small-scale model (SSM). This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components. On the one hand, the SSM reveals how vanilla empirical risk minimization preferentially learns to distinguish majority classes over minorities early in training, consequently delaying minority learning. In stark contrast, reweighting restores balanced learning dynamics, enabling the simultaneous learning of features associated with both majorities and minorities."}

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness."}

We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR).

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled framework for auditing these risks, yet existing methods achieve limited detection rates, particularly at the low false-positive thresholds required for practical privacy auditing. We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR). These results establish that privacy risks of fine-tuned language models are substantially greater than previously understood, with implications for both privacy auditing and deployment decisions.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful solution that embeds physical laws in training by enforcing equation residuals. However, these struggle to model nonlinear dynamics, suffering from limited generalization across problems and long training times. To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability. This work connects long-standing perturbation methods with PINNs, demonstrating how perturbation theory can guide foundational models to solve nonlinear systems with speeds comparable to those of classical solvers."}

To mitigate these problems, we propose using embedding vectors for numbers instead of directly using their raw values. These embeddings aim to retain essential algebraic properties while preventing numerical instabilities. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties. These findings highlight the model's strengths in preserving algebraic properties under addition while identifying avenues for further improvement in handling multiplication."}

A major challenge is the absence of accessible benchmark datasets for evaluating privacy risks, due to difficulties in acquiring sensitive data. To address this, we introduce SynQP, an open framework for benchmarking privacy in synthetic data generation (SDG) using simulated sensitive data, ensuring that original data remains confidential. We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches. Our work provides a critical tool for improving the transparency and reliability of privacy evaluations, enabling safer use of synthetic data in health-related applications. % In our quality evaluations, non-private models achieved near-perfect machine-learning efficacy \\(\\ge0.97\\).

Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts.\n  We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics. A small pilot student comprehension study further suggests improved clarity and accessibility of the generated explanations. Ablation experiments indicate that combining domain-adaptive pretraining with pedagogical fine-tuning is important for balancing scientific accuracy and educational effectiveness.

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer\" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function.

We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead. It leverages efficient state representations from target model hidden states and introduces multi-step action persistence for better context modeling. Evaluation results across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the SOTA method EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.45$\\times$ speedup over the backbone LLM and up to 1.12$\\times$ speedup compared to EAGLE-3 across five diverse benchmarks, with no loss in output fidelity."}

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 ε^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $ε^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach. On three MovieLens datasets, our algorithm reduces bias by $88\\%$ relative to baseline estimators. We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data. On an Amazon reviews dataset with sparsity $10^{-7}$, our method reduces the recovery error of $T$ by $59\\%$ and $M$ by $38\\%$ compared to baseline methods."}

While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models."}

The model uses modality specific encoders and a shared temporal backbone pretrained with self supervised and cross modal objectives. This design produces representations that are temporally coherent and clinically grounded. Across forecasting physiological and risk modeling tasks the model outperforms strong electronic health record only and wearable only baselines especially at long horizons and under missing data.

These logs are often multi-channel, non-stationary, and anomalies are rare, making anomaly detection challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates wavelet-aware modulation, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and resolution-adaptive attention for robust anomaly detection. Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection. On the CERT r4.2 benchmark, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score across various time granularities and scenarios."}

This motivates an investigation into the reasons behind such behavior beyond algorithmic design. In this study, we find that one such reason lies in the distribution shift across training domains. A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa. We also prove that, under certain data conditions, ERM solutions can achieve performance comparable to that of invariant prediction models. Secondly, the empirical validation results demonstrated that the predictions of learned models approximate those of Oracle or Optimal models, provided that the degree of distribution shift in the training data increases."}

It records detailed functional attributes, quality of service metrics, and composition-specific indicators, enabling systematic analysis of service performance and cross-service behaviour. Using MDG, we generate more than ten thousand MLaaS service instances and construct a large-scale benchmark dataset suitable for downstream evaluation. We also implement a built-in composition mechanism that models how services interact under varied Internet of Things conditions.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel method, called \\underline{or}dered \\underline{lo}cal \\underline{mo}mentum (OrLoMo), for asynchronous distributed learning.

They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for detecting and predicting stiction using only routinely collected process signals: the controller output (OP) from control systems and the process variable (PV), such as flow rate. Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing control systems to support predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and avoid unnecessary hardware replacement."}

We propose Statistical-Neural Interaction (SNI), an interpretable mixed-type imputation framework that couples correlation-derived statistical priors with neural feature attention through a Controllable-Prior Feature Attention (CPFA) module. CPFA learns head-wise prior-strength coefficients $\\{λ_h\\}$ that softly regularize attention toward the prior while allowing data-driven deviations when nonlinear patterns appear to be present in the data. Beyond imputation, SNI aggregates attention maps into a directed feature-dependency matrix that summarizes which variables the imputer relied on, without requiring post-hoc explainers. We evaluate SNI against six baselines (Mean/Mode, MICE, KNN, MissForest, GAIN, MIWAE) on six datasets spanning ICU monitoring, population surveys, socio-economic statistics, and engineering applications. Under MCAR/strict-MAR at 30\\% missingness, SNI is generally competitive on continuous metrics but is often outperformed by accuracy-first baselines (MissForest, MIWAE) on categorical variables; in return, it provides intrinsic dependency diagnostics and explicit statistical-neural trade-off parameters. We additionally report MNAR stress tests (with a mask-aware variant) and discuss computational cost, limitations -- particularly for severely imbalanced categorical targets -- and deployment scenarios where interpretability may justify the trade-off."}

Although strong epidemiological evidence links oral health outcomes to socio-economic and demographic determinants, most artificial intelligence (AI) applications in dentistry rely on image-based diagnosis and black-box prediction models, limiting transparency and ethical applicability in pediatric populations.\n  Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning framework for pediatric dental risk stratification that prioritizes interpretability, calibration, and ethical deployment over maximal predictive accuracy.\n  Methods: A supervised machine learning model was trained using population-level pediatric data including age, income-to-poverty ratio, race/ethnicity, gender, and medical history. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves. Explainability was achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide global and individual-level interpretation of predictions.\n  Results: The model achieved modest discrimination (AUC = 0.61) with conservative calibration, underestimating risk at higher probability levels. SHAP analysis identified age and income-to-poverty ratio as the strongest contributors to predicted risk, followed by race/ethnicity and gender.\n  Conclusion: Explainable machine learning enables transparent, prevention-oriented pediatric dental risk stratification and supports population screening and equitable resource allocation rather than diagnostic decision-making."}

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting."}

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized."}

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments."}

We propose several improvements that address these fundamental challenges, namely, a Hessian regularization scheme that penalizes unphysical signatures in the Lagrangian's second derivatives with respect to velocities, preventing the network from learning unstable dynamics, activation functions that are better suited to the problem of learning Lagrangians, and a physics-aware coordinate scaling that improves stability. We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings. To deal with the relativistic setting, we extended our regularization to penalize violations of Lorentzian signatures, which allowed us to predict a geodesic Lagrangian under AdS\\textsubscript{4} spacetime metric directly from trajectory data, which to our knowledge has not been done in the literature before. This opens new possibilities for automated discovery of geometric structures in physics, including extraction of spacetime metric tensor components from geodesic trajectories.

While the most common decision tree learning algorithms treat data as a batch, numerous algorithms have been proposed to construct decision trees from a data stream. A standard training strategy involves augmenting the current tree by changing a leaf node into a split. Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + α)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(α^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points. Similarly, for Gini index, we achieve $(1 + α)$ approximation in amortized $O(α^{-1} + m \\log d)$ time. Our approach is beneficial for sparse data where $m \\ll d$. In our experiments we find almost-optimal splits efficiently, faster than the baseline, overperforming the theoretical approximation guarantees."}

In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montréal Area (Québec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the prevailing practice and show clear potential to delay costly grid upgrades."}

In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability.

In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence. Although this can be mitigated by preconditioning, this solution is often computationally expensive. Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization."}

Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \\tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.\n  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\\log(λ)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$. Given a spectral floor $r \\leq λ_{\\min}$, we obtain moment-constrained lower bounds, yielding a provable interval for $\\log\\det(A)$. A gap diagnostic indicates when to trust the point estimate and when to report bounds. All estimators and bounds cost $O(m)$, independent of $n$. For $m \\in \\{4, \\ldots, 8\\}$, this is effectively constant time."}

Evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to generating such perturbations due to their ability to navigate non-convex, gradient-free landscapes. In this work, we introduce a float-coded, penalty-driven single-objective evolutionary framework for UAP generation that achieves lower visibility perturbations while enhancing attack success rates. Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures. Additionally, we ensure the universality of the generated perturbations by testing across diverse models and by periodically switching batches to prevent overfitting. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently produces perturbations with smaller norms, higher misclassification effectiveness, and faster convergence compared to existing evolutionary-based methods. These findings highlight the robustness and scalability of our approach for universal adversarial attacks across various deep learning architectures."}

Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks.

SHAP, in particular, is often treated as a reliable account of which features drove an individual prediction. Yet SHAP explanations can vary substantially across repeated runs even when the input, task, and trained model are held fixed. We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

By selecting and integrating appropriate tools, LLMs extend their capabilities beyond pure language understanding to perform specialized functions. However, existing methods for tool selection often focus on limited tool sets and struggle to generalize to novel tools encountered in practical deployments. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains, containing 155 tools and 9,377 question-answer pairs, which simulates realistic integration scenarios. Additionally, we propose MetaToolAgent (MTA), a meta-learning approach designed to improve cross-tool generalization. Experimental results show that MTA significantly outperforms baseline methods on unseen tools, demonstrating its promise for building flexible and scalable systems that require dynamic tool coordination."}

DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms. Our T3P MAB algorithm is deployed on a variety of microcontroller unit (MCU) setups to show its efficiency in terms of power consumption as opposed to other existing RL approaches used in recent work."}

We apply this principle to neural networks: perturbing the data distribution by upweighting a token $y$ in context $x$, we measure the model's response via susceptibilities $χ_{xy}$, which are covariances between component-level observables and the perturbation computed over a localized Gibbs posterior via stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). Theoretically, we show that susceptibilities decompose as a sum over modes of the data distribution, explaining why tokens that follow their contexts \"for similar reasons\" cluster together in susceptibility space. Empirically, we apply this methodology to Pythia-14M, developing a conductance-based clustering algorithm that identifies 510 interpretable clusters ranging from grammatical patterns to code structure to mathematical notation. Comparing to sparse autoencoders, 50% of our clusters match SAE features, validating that both methods recover similar structure."}

We develop a physics-informed (PI) machine learning algorithm based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that concurrently optimizes the network architecture and predicts the target option price. The physics-informed radial basis function neural network (PIRBFNN) combines the strengths of the traditional radial basis function collocation method and the physics-informed neural network machine learning approach to effectively solve PDE problems in the financial context. By employing a PDE residual-based technique to adaptively refine the distribution of hidden neurons during the training process, the PIRBFNN facilitates accurate and efficient handling of multidimensional option pricing models featuring non-smooth payoff conditions. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a set of experiments encompassing a single-asset European put option, a double-asset exchange option, and a four-asset basket call option."}

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series."}

Submitted to Operations Research", "summary": "Estimating the unknown reward functions driving agents' behaviors is of central interest in inverse reinforcement learning and game theory. To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments."}

With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average.

Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of \"pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning\" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning \"pre-training\" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method."}

The accurate representation of ocean dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales remains a major challenge in such applications. This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions. These results indicate that the proposed model delivers more accurate short-term forecasts and improved representation of multi-scale ocean dynamics, thereby highlighting its potential to advance data-driven, eddy-resolving global ocean forecasting."}

While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when incorporated into state-of-the-art graph instruction tuning methods, SIT-Graph significantly enhances their performance on text-attributed graph benchmarks, achieving over 20% improvement under the low label ratio settings."}

Unlike existing methods that operate in Euclidean parameter space, FOPNG projects gradients onto the Fisher-orthogonal complement of previous task gradients. This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. The resulting update direction is invariant under reparameterization, guarantees descent in the Fisher metric, and helps preserve prior task outputs.

We operationalize this with a practical meta-evaluation of our fingerprints' descriptive power, which bypasses the need for large, human-rated datasets. This test measures if a simple linear classifier can reliably identify various model configurations by their created simplifications, confirming that our metrics are sensitive to a model's specific characteristics. The Profiler can distinguish high-level behavioral variations between prompting strategies and fine-grained changes from prompt engineering, including few-shot examples.

We propose that measuring a model's unique behavioral signature is more relevant in this context as an alternative to correlating metrics with human preferences. We operationalize this with a practical meta-evaluation of our fingerprints' descriptive power, which bypasses the need for large, human-rated datasets. This test measures if a simple linear classifier can reliably identify various model configurations by their created simplifications, confirming that our metrics are sensitive to a model's specific characteristics. The Profiler can distinguish high-level behavioral variations between prompting strategies and fine-grained changes from prompt engineering, including few-shot examples. Our complete feature set achieves classification F1-scores up to 71.9 %, improving upon simple baselines by over 48 percentage points. The Simplification Profiler thus offers developers a granular, actionable analysis to build more effective and truly adaptive text simplification systems."}

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability."}

Their restricted conformational flexibility provides structural pre-organization that is key to their function in drug discovery and catalysis.

Our approach enables generation of valid closed rings by design and demonstrates strong performance in generating conformers that are both diverse and precise. We show that PuckerFlow outperforms other conformer generation methods on nearly all quantitative metrics and illustrate the potential of PuckerFlow for ring systems relevant to chemical applications, particularly in catalysis and drug discovery.

The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks. On modular arithmetic tasks, the framework achieves up to 91% behavioral preservation ($\\pm$2.3\\% across runs) while maintaining interpretable subgraph sizes.

By leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), we propose a novel adaptation framework that accommodates the unique characteristics of distribution shifts in time series data. Moreover, we innovatively propose a new loss function to tackle TTA for forecasting tasks. AdaNODEs only requires updating limited model parameters, showing effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies while avoiding significant memory usage. Extensive experiments with one- and high-dimensional data demonstrate that AdaNODEs offer relative improvements of 5.88\\% and 28.4\\% over the SOTA baselines, especially demonstrating robustness across higher severity distribution shifts."}

Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs. Our framework is easily extendable to other inventory models, offering an efficient and fast alternative for analyzing complex stochastic systems."}

Our novel benchmark PMR-Bench contains 1569 unique messages and 2,000+ high-quality test pairs for pairwise medical urgency assessment alongside a scalable training data generation pipeline. PMR-Bench includes samples that contain both unstructured patient-written messages alongside real electronic health record (EHR) data, emulating a real-world medical triage scenario.\n  We develop a novel automated data annotation strategy to provide LLMs with in-domain guidance on this task. The resulting data is used to train two model classes, UrgentReward and UrgentSFT, leveraging Bradley-Terry and next token prediction objective, respectively to perform pairwise urgency classification. We find that UrgentSFT achieves top performance on PMR-Bench, with UrgentReward showing distinct advantages in low-resource settings. For example, UrgentSFT-8B and UrgentReward-8B provide a 15- and 16-point boost, respectively, on inbox sorting metrics over off-the-shelf 8B models.

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs."}

Similarly, online time series forecasting (OTSF) is a real-world problem where data evolve in time and success depends on both rapid adaptation and long-term memory. Indeed, time-varying and regime-switching forecasting models have been extensively studied, offering a strong justification for the use of OCL in these settings. Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods."}

While the effectiveness of these models can be theoretically explained using differential equations related to the sampling process, previous work by Song and Ermon (2020) demonstrated that neural networks using multiplicative noise conditioning can still generate satisfactory samples. In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude. This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates."}

In practice, however, their performance is often hindered by limited representational capacity and optimization difficulties caused by competing physical constraints and conflicting gradients. In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs. These results highlight the effectiveness of architecture-optimization co-design for improving the robustness and accuracy of PINN-based solvers."}

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models."}

However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters. Our code will be released upon acceptance."}

To ensure the reliability of our proposed system, we conducted an in-depth analysis of interpretability. Leveraging techniques established in the literature, we extracted features from blood cells and employed ensemble machine learning methods to classify their morphology. Furthermore, we have devised a methodology to identify the most critical features for classification, aimed at reducing complexity and training time and enhancing interpretability in opaque models. Lastly, we validated our results using a new dataset, where our model overperformed state-of-the-art models in terms of generalization. The results of classifier ensembled of Random Forest and Extra Trees classifier achieved an harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1-score) of 90.71\\% and a Sickle Cell Disease diagnosis support score (SDS-score) of 93.33\\%.

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE < 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings. This work provides a practical, cost-effective blueprint for bridging the technological divide in agriculture and enhancing water-use efficiency through on-device artificial intelligence."}

However, the mathematical behavior of recursive or multi-generation distillation remains poorly understood, with prior approaches relying primarily on empirical heuristics. In this work, we introduce an axiomatic and operator-theoretic framework for recursive meta-distillation, formalizing iterative knowledge distillation as a sequence of probability-distribution operators with explicit anchoring to base teachers.\n  We define structural axioms for valid meta-teacher construction and prove the existence of non-trivial operator families satisfying these axioms without specifying particular algorithms or loss functions. Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints."}

While token pruning has been actively explored in standard large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs), its application to AV-LLMs has received little attention, even though multimodal integration substantially increases their token demands. To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastAV reduces FLOPs by more than 40% on two representative AV-LLMs, while preserving or even improving model performance."}

Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.\n  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes."}

Despite this, evidence suggests that study registrations frequently go unexamined, minimizing their effectiveness. In a way this is no surprise: manually checking registrations against papers is labour- and time-intensive, requiring careful reading across formats and expertise across domains. The advent of AI unlocks new possibilities in facilitating this activity. We present RegCheck, a modular LLM-assisted tool designed to help researchers, reviewers, and editors from across scientific disciplines compare study registrations with their corresponding papers. Importantly, RegCheck keeps human expertise and judgement in the loop by (i) ensuring that users are the ones who determine which features should be compared, and (ii) presenting the most relevant text associated with each feature to the user, facilitating (rather than replacing) human discrepancy judgements.

Despite this, evidence suggests that study registrations frequently go unexamined, minimizing their effectiveness. In a way this is no surprise: manually checking registrations against papers is labour- and time-intensive, requiring careful reading across formats and expertise across domains. The advent of AI unlocks new possibilities in facilitating this activity. We present RegCheck, a modular LLM-assisted tool designed to help researchers, reviewers, and editors from across scientific disciplines compare study registrations with their corresponding papers. Importantly, RegCheck keeps human expertise and judgement in the loop by (i) ensuring that users are the ones who determine which features should be compared, and (ii) presenting the most relevant text associated with each feature to the user, facilitating (rather than replacing) human discrepancy judgements. RegCheck also generates shareable reports with unique RegCheck IDs, enabling them to be easily shared and verified by other users.

Using the GTSRB dataset, we evaluate robustness against FGSM and PGD attacks at a standard $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbation budget of $\\varepsilon = 8/255$. Relative to clean training, standard adversarial training provides modest improvements in robustness ($\\sim$10 percentage points). Conversely, our FGSM-Neuro-Symbolic and PGD-Neuro-Symbolic models achieve substantially larger gains, improving adversarial accuracy by 18.1\\% and 17.35\\% over their corresponding adversarial-training baselines, representing roughly a three-fold larger robustness gain than standard adversarial training provides when both are measured relative to the same clean-training baseline, without reducing clean-sample accuracy. Compared to transformer-based defenses such as LNL-MoEx, which require heavy architectures and extensive data augmentation, our PGD-Neuro-Symbolic variant attains comparable or superior robustness using a ResNet18 backbone trained for 10 epochs.

This is essential for ensuring both operational performance and long-term safety. While high fidelity multiphase simulators are widely used for this purpose, they become prohibitively expensive once many forward runs are required for inversion purposes and quantify uncertainty. To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and unified evaluation of reasoning paradigms, spanning direct single-model generation, CoT-augmented single-model reasoning, and representative MAS workflows, characterizing their reasoning performance across a diverse suite of closed-form benchmarks. Beyond overall performance, we probe role-specific capability demands in MAS using targeted role isolation analyses, and analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs to identify which MAS workflows offer a favorable balance between cost and accuracy, and which incur prohibitive overhead for marginal gains. We further introduce MIMeBench, a new open-ended benchmark that targets two foundational yet underexplored semantic capabilities - semantic abstraction and contrastive discrimination - thereby providing an alternative evaluation axis beyond closed-form accuracy and enabling fine-grained assessment of semantic competence that is difficult to capture with existing benchmarks. Our results show that increased structural complexity does not consistently lead to improved reasoning performance, with its benefits being highly dependent on the properties and suitability of the reasoning paradigm itself.

We investigate this by evaluating base and instruction-tuned models on standard math benchmarks, structurally perturbed variants, and domain-shifted tasks. Our analysis highlights two key (often overlooked) limitations of instruction tuning. First, the performance advantage is unstable and depends heavily on evaluation settings. In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning. Second, tuning gains are brittle under distribution shift. Our results show that base models surpass instruction-tuned variants on the domain-specific MedCalc benchmark. Additionally, instruction-tuned models show sharp declines on perturbed datasets, indicating sensitivity to prompt structure over robust reasoning."}

Well-calibrated confidence enables downstream systems to decide when to trust a model and when to defer to fallback mechanisms. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of calibration in two widely used fine-tuning paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives. Based on this insight, we propose a calibration-aware reinforcement learning formulation that directly adjusts decision-token probabilities.

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

However, accuracy drops sharply on unseen problems (by 30-64%), with failures stemming from systematic misinterpretation of language constraints, incorrect handling of Kleene-star semantics, and a failure to preserve global consistency. We evaluate a three-stage hint protocol that enables correction of shallow errors but does not reliably resolve globally inconsistent or structurally flawed automata. Our analysis across multiple prompting strategies (direct, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought) reveals that errors persist regardless of prompting approach, exposing a fundamental gap between LLMs' ability to generate syntactically plausible DFAs and their capacity for semantically correct formal reasoning."}

However, the computational cost of verifying large-scale models remains a significant barrier to adoption. This paper investigates the impact of pruning on formal local robustness certificates with different ratios. Using the state-of-the-art $α,β$-CROWN verifier, we evaluate ResNet4 models across varying pruning ratios on MNIST and, more importantly, on the NASA JPL Mars Frost Identification datasets. Our findings demonstrate a non-linear relationship: light pruning (40%) in MNIST and heavy pruning (70%-90%) in JPL improve verifiability, allowing models to outperform unpruned baselines in proven $L_\\infty$ robustness properties. This suggests that reduced connectivity simplifies the search space for formal solvers and that the optimal pruning ratio varies significantly between datasets. This research highlights the complex nature of model compression, offering critical insights into selecting the optimal pruning ratio for deploying efficient, yet formally verified, DNNs in high-stakes environments where reliability is non-negotiable."}

Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.\n  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization. By highlighting both structural similarities and semantic differences, we clarify when these models are equivalent, when they fundamentally diverge, and how modern NLP SSMs relate to classical probabilistic models. Our analysis bridges perspectives from control theory, probabilistic modeling, and modern deep learning."}

We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms.

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability.

This paper introduces a domain-specific implicit generative framework for turbine blade geometry using DeepSDF, addressing critical gaps in performance-aware modeling and manufacturable design generation. The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry. The framework achieves high reconstruction fidelity, with surface distance errors concentrated within $1\\%$ of the maximum blade dimension, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen designs. By integrating constraints, objectives, and performance metrics, this approach advances beyond traditional 2D-guided or unconstrained 3D pipelines, offering a practical and interpretable solution for data-driven turbine blade modeling and concept generation."}

This issue arises frequently in traditional in-processing approaches such as fairness-through-regularization. In contrast, existing Pareto-efficient approaches are biased towards a certain perspective on fairness and fail to adapt to the broad range of fairness metrics studied in the literature. In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective. We equip our framework with two novel large-scale, single-loop algorithms, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD, and establish their convergence guarantees. We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of BADR over existing Pareto-efficient approaches to fairness."}

In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics."}

However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond."}

However, real-world EV datasets are often plagued by missing records, and existing imputation methods are ill-equipped for the complex, multimodal context of charging data, often relying on a restrictive one-model-per-station paradigm that ignores valuable inter-station correlations. To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance."}

Among various tensor models, low-Tucker-rank tensors are particularly attractive for capturing multi-mode subspace structures in high-dimensional data. Existing recovery methods either operate on the full tensor variable with expensive tensor projections, or adopt factorized formulations that still rely on full-gradient computations, while most stochastic factorized approaches are restricted to tensor decomposition settings. In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors. Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines."}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

We introduce patterning as the dual problem: given a desired form of generalization, determine what training data produces it. Our approach is based on susceptibilities, which measure how posterior expectation values of observables respond to infinitesimal shifts in the data distribution. Inverting this linear response relationship yields the data intervention that steers the model toward a target internal configuration. We demonstrate patterning in a small language model, showing that re-weighting training data along principal susceptibility directions can accelerate or delay the formation of structure, such as the induction circuit. In a synthetic parentheses balancing task where multiple algorithms achieve perfect training accuracy, we show that patterning can select which algorithm the model learns by targeting the local learning coefficient of each solution. These results establish that the same mathematical framework used to read internal structure can be inverted to write it."}

We introduce ButterflyMoE, a method that treats experts not as independent weight matrices but as geometric reorientations of a unified shared quantized substrate. Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \\cdot d \\log d)$ memory -- sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse. Across language modeling benchmarks, ButterflyMoE achieves 150 times memory reduction at 256 experts with negligible accuracy loss. This allows 64 experts to fit on 4GB devices compared to standard MoE's 8 experts, showing geometric parametrization breaks linear scaling."}

Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design."}

This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks.

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains."}

However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains."}

We propose FG-OrIU (\\textbf{F}eature-\\textbf{G}radient \\textbf{Or}thogonality for \\textbf{I}ncremental \\textbf{U}nlearning), the first framework unifying orthogonal constraints on both features and gradients level to achieve deep forgetting, where the forgetting effect is irreversible. FG-OrIU decomposes feature spaces via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), separating forgetting and remaining class features into distinct subspaces. It then enforces dual constraints: feature orthogonal projection on both forgetting and remaining classes, while gradient orthogonal projection prevents the reintroduction of forgotten knowledge and disruption to remaining classes during updates. Additionally, dynamic subspace adaptation merges newly forgetting subspaces and contracts remaining subspaces, ensuring a stable balance between removal and retention across sequential unlearning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Decoder-only transformers (124M-20B parameters). Complete experimental results and reproducibility details in appendices. Code and checkpoints: https://github.com/zuraiqi/neural-organ-transplant", "summary": "We introduce Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT), a modular adaptation framework that enables trained transformer layers to function as reusable transferable checkpoints for domain adaptation. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

One solution is to use machine learning methods to simulate the radiation process to improve computational efficiency. From an operational standpoint, this study investigates critical limitations inherent to hybrid forecasting frameworks that embed deep neural networks into numerical prediction models, with a specific focus on two fundamental bottlenecks: coupling compatibility and long-term integration stability. A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

However, their strict unidirectional block dependencies introduce irreversibility and sacrifice the global planning capabilities for which diffusion models are renowned. In order to address these issues, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a draft-then-refine framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using just 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models."}

Under non-IID data, these uniformly weighted updates can be strongly misaligned across clients, causing client drift and degrading the global model. Here we propose Fisher-Informed Parameterwise Aggregation (FIPA), a second-order aggregation method that replaces client-level scalar weights with parameter-specific Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) weights, enabling true parameter-level scaling that captures how each client's data uniquely influences different parameters. With low-rank approximation, FIPA remains communication- and computation-efficient. Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy. These results highlight the benefits of FIPA for federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions."}

To teach the LLM-based Time Series Reasoning Models (TSRMs) strategic tool-use, we also collect a 100k expert trajectory corpus called TimeToolBench. To enhance TSRMs' generalization capability, we then devise a four-stage training strategy, which boosts TSRMs through learning from their own early experiences and self-reflections. Experimentally, we train an 8B TSRM on TimeToolBench and equip it with the TimeART framework, and it achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on multiple TSQA tasks, which pioneers a novel approach towards agentic time series reasoning."}

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware. Our proposed deep learning framework enables rapid, smooth and accurate biomechanical simulations of dynamic brain tissue deformation, laying the foundation for realistic surgical training environments."}

Despite extensive research on these individual topics, the relationship between fairness and privacy has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we utilize the information-theoretic measure Chernoff Information to highlight the data-dependent nature of the relationship among the triad of fairness, privacy, and accuracy. We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications. Additionally, we show that Noisy Chernoff Difference acts as a proxy for the steepness of the fairness-accuracy curves. Finally, we propose a method for estimating Chernoff Information on data from unknown distributions and utilize this framework to examine the triad dynamic on real datasets. This work builds towards a unified understanding of the fairness-privacy-accuracy relationship and highlights its data-dependent nature."}

We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities.

Many deep learning models face a persistent trade-off between capturing local spatiotemporal patterns and maintaining informative long-range context when operating on ultralong sequences. We propose EEG-Titans, a dualbranch architecture that incorporates a modern neural memory mechanism for long-context modeling. The model combines sliding-window attention to capture short-term anomalies with a recurrent memory pathway that summarizes slower, progressive trends over time. On the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, evaluated under a chronological holdout protocol, EEG-Titans achieves 99.46% average segment-level sensitivity across 18 subjects. We further analyze safety-first operating points on artifact-prone recordings and show that a hierarchical context strategy extending the receptive field for high-noise subjects can markedly reduce false alarms (down to 0.00 FPR/h in an extreme outlier) without sacrificing sensitivity.

However, their application to autonomous Electronic Health Records~(EHRs) navigation remains constrained by a reliance on curated inputs and simplified retrieval tasks. To bridge the gap between idealized experimental settings and realistic clinical environments, we present AgentEHR. This benchmark challenges agents to execute complex decision-making tasks, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, requiring long-range interactive reasoning directly within raw and high-noise databases. In tackling these tasks, we identify that existing summarization methods inevitably suffer from critical information loss and fractured reasoning continuity. To address this, we propose RetroSum, a novel framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. By dynamically re-evaluating interaction history, the retrospective mechanism prevents long-context information loss and ensures unbroken logical coherence. Additionally, the evolving strategy bridges the domain gap by retrieving accumulated experience from a memory bank. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RetroSum achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% over competitive baselines, while significantly decreasing total interaction errors by up to 92.3%."}

Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models. In this latent space, we train a Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, enabling efficient and expressive graph generation. Our approach achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art graph diffusion models, while achieving up to $1000\\times$ speed-up."}

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable. We validate our approach using real-world driving datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by effectively integrating road characteristics, real-time traffic conditions, and historical speed patterns in a task-aware manner."}

To address these, we propose ELSA (Efficient LLM-centric Split Aggregation), a novel framework that systematically integrates split learning (SL) and hierarchical federated learning (HFL) for distributed LLM fine-tuning over resource-constrained edge networks. ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges. Experiments across diverse NLP tasks demonstrate that ELSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, convergence behavior, and robustness, establishing a scalable and privacy-aware solution for edge-side LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints."}

Furthermore, we prove that the optimal fixed regularization strength scales nearly linearly with the number of tasks $T$, specifically as $T/\\ln T$.

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

Conventional strategies rank high in benchmarks due to their intrinsic capabilities to handle numerical inputs and careful modelling choices that balance exploration and Pareto-front exploitation, as well as handle multiple (conflicting) objectives. In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance. Empirically, it consistently outperforms the global LLM-based multi-objective optimizer and is on par with standard evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks."}

To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization. Experiments on HCP, ISMRM, and TractoInferno datasets demonstrate that TractRLFusion outperforms individual RL policies as well as state-of-the-art classical and DRL methods in accuracy and anatomical reliability."}

Code available at https://github.com/gogipav14/spectral-llm", "summary": "Learning precise Boolean logic via gradient descent remains challenging: neural networks typically converge to \"fuzzy\" approximations that degrade under quantization. We introduce Hierarchical Spectral Composition, a differentiable architecture that selects spectral coefficients from a frozen Boolean Fourier basis and composes them via Sinkhorn-constrained routing with column-sign modulation. Our approach draws on recent insights from Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), which demonstrated that projecting routing matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope preserves identity mappings and stabilizes large-scale training. We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.\n  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity). (3) For n=4 (10 four-variable operations over 16-dim basis), spectral synthesis -- combining exact Walsh-Hadamard coefficients, ternary quantization, and MCMC refinement with parallel tempering -- achieves 100% accuracy on all operations. This progression establishes (a) that ternary polynomial threshold representations exist for all tested functions, and (b) that finding them requires methods beyond pure gradient descent as dimensionality grows. All operations enable single-cycle combinational logic inference at 10,959 MOps/s on GPU, demonstrating viability for hardware-efficient neuro-symbolic logic synthesis."}

Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\\% and 8.80\\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively.

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing."}

This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for like-for-like operational assessment of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) under identical, real-world driving conditions. The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations."}

In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches have gained significant attention for addressing UAV path planning tasks in large and complex environments, bridging the gap with real-world deployments. However, many existing algorithms suffer from limited training data, which hampers their performance in highly dynamic environments. Moreover, they often overlook the inherently multi-objective nature of the task, treating it in an overly simplistic manner. To address these limitations, we propose an attention-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) architecture that explicitly handles the trade-off between data collection and energy consumption in urban environments, even without prior knowledge of wireless channel conditions. Our method develops a single model capable of adapting to varying trade-off preferences and dynamic scenario parameters without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Extensive simulations show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in performance, model compactness, sample efficiency, and most importantly, generalization to previously unseen scenarios, outperforming existing RL solutions."}

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TDPCM."}

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

We show that TPBS models admit a closed-form expression for the Dirichlet energy, and reveal scenarios where perfect interpolation is possible with exponentially small Dirichlet energy. This renders global Dirichlet energy-based regularization ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization."}

We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions.

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery."}

As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

While previous work focuses on post-join detection or complex privacy models, little attention has been given to simple, interpretable pre-join indicators that can warn data engineers and database administrators before integration occurs. This study investigates the uniqueness ratio of candidate join attributes as an early predictor of re-identification risk. Using synthetic multi-table datasets, we compute the uniqueness ratio of attribute combinations within each database and examine how these ratios correlate with identity exposure after the join. Experimental results show a strong relationship between high pre-join uniqueness and increased post-join leakage, measured by the proportion of records that become uniquely identifiable or fall into very small groups. Our findings demonstrate that uniqueness ratio offers an explainable and practical signal for assessing join induced privacy risk, providing a foundation for developing more comprehensive pre-join risk estimation models."}

Their structural differences, continual evolution, and limited cross-resource alignment require substantial manual integration, limiting the depth and scale of knowledge exploration. We introduce DeepEvidence, an AI-agent framework designed to perform Deep Research across various heterogeneous biomedical KGs. Unlike generic Deep Research systems that rely primarily on internet-scale text, DeepEvidence incorporates specialized knowledge-graph tooling and coordinated exploration strategies to systematically bridge heterogeneous resources. At its core is an orchestrator that directs two complementary agents: Breadth-First ReSearch (BFRS) for broad, multi-graph entity search, and Depth-First ReSearch (DFRS) for multi-hop, evidence-focused reasoning. An internal, incrementally built evidence graph provides a structured record of retrieved entities, relations, and supporting evidence. To operate at scale, DeepEvidence includes unified interfaces for querying diverse biomedical APIs and an execution sandbox that enables programmatic data retrieval, extraction, and analysis. Across established deep-reasoning benchmarks and four key stages of the biomedical discovery lifecycle: drug discovery, pre-clinical experimentation, clinical trial development, and evidence-based medicine, DeepEvidence demonstrates substantial gains in systematic exploration and evidence synthesis. These results highlight the potential of knowledge-graph-driven Deep Research to accelerate biomedical discovery."}

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration."}

Foundation and mathematical proofs can be found in the companion paper arXiv:2601.00638", "summary": "Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional \"Zero-Mode Attractor\" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \\equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence."}

Han"], "title": "Enhancing Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Context-Aware Server Collaboration", "categories": ["cs.DC", "cs.LG", "cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a widely used framework for enabling LLM-based agents to communicate with external tools and services. The most common implementation of MCP, proposed by Anthropic, heavily relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose tasks and issue instructions to servers, which act as stateless executors. In particular, the agents, models, and servers are stateless and do not have access to a global context. However, in tasks involving LLM-driven coordination, it is natural that a Shared Context Store (SCS) could improve the efficiency and coherence of multi-agent workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling knowledge transfer between servers. Thus, in this work, we design and assess the performance of a Context-Aware MCP (CA-MCP) that offloads execution logic to specialized MCP servers that read from and write to a shared context memory, allowing them to coordinate more autonomously in real time. In this design, context management serves as the central mechanism that maintains continuity across task executions by tracking intermediate states and shared variables, thereby enabling persistent collaboration among agents without repeated prompting. We present experiments showing that the CA-MCP can outperform the traditional MCP by reducing the number of LLM calls required for complex tasks and decreasing the frequency of response failures when task conditions are not satisfied, thereby improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. In particular, we conducted experiments on the TravelPlanner and REALM-Bench benchmark datasets and observed statistically significant results indicating the potential advantages of incorporating a shared context store via CA-MCP in LLM-driven multi-agent systems."}

To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (>0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%->83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice."}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally.

This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold. The algorithms span a trade-off between speed, provable accuracy, and scalability, enabling compression-aware clustering with explicit error control. Code is available online."}

Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality."}

In this research, we introduce a physics-based synthetic simulation framework (PSSF) to fully generate controllable X-ray scans without patients' involvement and violating their privacy and institutional constraints. This PSSF is a 2D X-ray projection simulator of anteroposterior knee radiographs from a parametric anatomical model of the distal femur and proximal tibia.

Practically, three machine learning (ML) models are utilized, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to train binary (KL-like \"0\" vs. \"2\") and three-class (0-2) prediction radiographic images. Robustness is assessed within IBSI protocol, cross-protocol, and multi-protocol scenarios.

Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation.

Gu"], "title": "CroBIM-V: Memory-Quality Controlled Remote Sensing Referring Video Object Segmentation", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Remote sensing video referring object segmentation (RS-RVOS) is challenged by weak target saliency and severe visual information truncation in dynamic scenes, making it extremely difficult to maintain discriminative target representations during segmentation. Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation. Extensive experiments on RS-RVOS Bench demonstrate that MQC-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to dynamically optimize CI/CD pipeline workflows. The pipeline is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, and an RL agent is trained to make runtime decisions such as selecting full, partial, or no test execution in order to maximize throughput while minimizing testing overhead.\n  A configurable CI/CD simulation environment is developed to evaluate the approach across build, test, and deploy stages. Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.\n  These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation."}

As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents."}

While U-Net offers a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency compared to large transformer-based models, achieving real-time performance on high-resolution input remains challenging due to compute, memory, and power limits. Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs.\n  We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency.\n  To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs. Across 3 segmentation benchmarks, MBU-Net attains near full-precision accuracy (3% average drop) while delivering 2.04x speedup and 3.54x energy reductions over a 16-bit floating point U-Net."}

Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival."}

This task can be framed as a reverse Turing test in which a computer has to detect if an input instance has been generated by a human or artificially. To tackle this task, we study ten public datasets of handwritten symbols (isolated characters, digits, gestures, pointing traces, and signatures) that are artificially reproduced using seven different synthesizers, including, among others, the Kinematic Theory (Sigma h model), generative adversarial networks, Transformers, and Diffusion models. We train a shallow recurrent neural network that achieves excellent performance (98.3 percent Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score and 1.4 percent equal error rate on average across all synthesizers and datasets) using nonfeaturized trajectory data as input. In few-shot settings, we show that our classifier achieves such an excellent performance when trained on just 10 percent of the data, as evaluated on the remaining 90% of the data as a test set. We further challenge our classifier in out-of-domain settings, and observe very competitive results as well.

We study an authorship de-anonymization threat: using LLMs to link anonymous documents to their authors, potentially compromising settings such as double-blind peer review.\n  We propose De-Anonymization at Scale (DAS), a large language model-based method for attributing authorship among tens of thousands of candidate texts. DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision.

We study an authorship de-anonymization threat: using LLMs to link anonymous documents to their authors, potentially compromising settings such as double-blind peer review.\n  We propose De-Anonymization at Scale (DAS), a large language model-based method for attributing authorship among tens of thousands of candidate texts. DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision.

We present the design of an end-to-end wireless autoencoder architecture that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver encoding/decoding in the Walsh domain to mitigate interference from coexisting narrower-band 5G base stations. By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection. Experimental results show that the proposed autoencoder achieves up to 12 dB of ICI rejection while maintaining a low block error rate (BLER) for the same baseline channel noise, i.e., baseline Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) without the interference."}

To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments."}

As a result, recent work incorporates some 3D tasks (such as depth estimation) into VFM training. However, VFM performance remains inconsistent across other spatial tasks, raising the question of whether these models truly have spatial awareness or overfit to specific 3D objectives. To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities. Through our analysis, we provide insights into the mechanisms that support or hinder spatial awareness in modern VFMs. We hope that SpaRRTa will serve as a useful tool for guiding the development of future spatially aware visual models."}

These heuristic perturbations frequently generate semantically invalid, out-of-distribution inputs that weaken the fidelity of local surrogate models. While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict \"Single Mask-Single Sample\" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth. Empirical results demonstrate that LIME-LLM establishes a new benchmark for black-box NLP explainability, achieving significant improvements in local explanation fidelity compared to both traditional perturbation-based methods and recent generative alternatives."}

This work presents a transparent approach to social media-based anxiety detection through linguistically interpretable feature-grounded modeling and cross-domain validation. Using a substantial dataset of Reddit posts, we trained a logistic regression classifier on carefully curated subreddits for training, validation, and test splits. Comprehensive evaluation included feature ablation, keyword masking experiments, and varying-density difference analyses comparing anxious and control groups, along with external validation using clinically interviewed participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders. The model achieved strong performance while maintaining high accuracy even after sentiment removal or keyword masking. Early detection using minimal post history significantly outperformed random classification, and cross-domain analysis demonstrated strong consistency with clinical interview data. Results indicate that transparent linguistic features can support reliable, generalizable, and keyword-robust anxiety detection.

SSVD-O combines input acoustic feature space-associated inner transformations with output semantic feature space-associated outer transformations to enable scalable and balanced adaptation. We conduct the first systematic analysis of parameter budget allocation across model subspaces in PEFT for automatic speech recognition (ASR), and investigate the trade-off between learning and forgetting under constrained resources. SSVD-O is benchmarked against LoRA, DoRA, PiSSA, and SSVD on domain-shifted ASR tasks, including child speech and regional accents, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B within the ESPnet framework. Experimental results show that SSVD-O consistently narrows the performance gap to full fine-tuning while improving generalization and mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

Although the concept of granularity holds significant value for business applications by providing deeper insights, the capability of topic modeling methods to produce granular topics has not been thoroughly explored. In this context, this paper introduces a framework called TIDE, which primarily provides a novel granular topic modeling method based on large language models (LLMs) as a core feature, along with other useful functionalities for business applications, such as summarizing long documents, topic parenting, and distillation. Through extensive experiments on a variety of public and real-world business datasets, we demonstrate that TIDE's topic modeling approach outperforms modern topic modeling methods, and our auxiliary components provide valuable support for dealing with industrial business scenarios. The TIDE framework is currently undergoing the process of being open sourced."}

A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage."}

More specifically, our method builds on recent advances in active learning for sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures, DGSM) that exploit derivatives obtained from a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. By leveraging the joint posterior distribution of the GP gradient, we develop acquisition functions that better account for correlations between partial derivatives and their impact on the response surface, leading to a more comprehensive and robust methodology than existing DGSM-oriented criteria.

The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases.

Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

Addressing this ``aging'' effect via frequent retraining is often impractical due to computational costs and privacy constraints. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Adversarial Drift-Aware Predictive Transfer (ADAPT), a novel framework designed to confer durability against temporal drift with minimal retraining. ADAPT innovatively constructs an uncertainty set of plausible future models by combining historical source models and limited current data. By optimizing worst-case performance over this set, it balances current accuracy with robustness against degradation due to future drifts. Crucially, ADAPT requires only summary-level model estimators from historical periods, preserving data privacy and ensuring operational simplicity. Validated on longitudinal suicide risk prediction using electronic health records from Mass General Brigham (2005--2021) and Duke University Health Systems, ADAPT demonstrated superior stability across coding transitions and pandemic-induced shifts. By minimizing annual performance decay without labeling or retraining future data, ADAPT offers a scalable pathway for sustaining reliable AI in high-stakes healthcare environments."}

The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches."}

Previous version with human-AI collaboration: arXiv:2410.14640", "summary": "We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

CNNs running on edge devices must have a small architecture, and CNNs for robot vision applications involving on-site object recognition must be able to be trained efficiently to identify specific visual targets from data obtained under a limited variation of conditions. The visual nervous system (VNS) is a good example that meets the above requirements because it learns from few visual experiences. Therefore, we used a Gabor filter, a model of the feature extractor of the VNS, as a preprocessor for CNNs to investigate the accuracy of the CNNs trained with small amounts of data. To evaluate how well CNNs trained on image data acquired under a limited variation of conditions generalize to data acquired under other conditions, we created an image dataset consisting of images acquired from different camera positions, and investigated the accuracy of the CNNs that trained using images acquired at a certain distance. The results were compared after training on multiple CNN architectures with and without Gabor filters as preprocessing.

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation."}

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers a potential advantage in processing high-dimensional data; however, finding the optimal architecture for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices remains an open challenge. This study investigates the performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) in detecting Higgs Boson signals using the ATLAS Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014 experiment dataset. We implemented a dimensionality reduction pipeline using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to map 30 physical features into 4-qubit and 8-qubit latent spaces. We benchmarked three configurations: (A) a shallow 4-qubit circuit, (B) a deep 4-qubit circuit with increased entanglement layers, and (C) an expanded 8-qubit circuit. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing circuit depth significantly improves performance, yielding the highest accuracy of 56.2% (Configuration B), compared to a baseline of 51.9%. Conversely, simply scaling to 8 qubits resulted in a performance degradation to 50.6% due to optimization challenges associated with Barren Plateaus in the larger Hilbert space. These findings suggest that for near-term quantum hardware, prioritizing circuit depth and entanglement capability is more critical than increasing qubit count for effective anomaly detection in HEP data."}

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

To defend against such attacks, rule based systems were initially developed but then were found to be ineffective to innovative injection attacks hence a model based approach was developed. Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored. A discriminant analysis was carried out to determine statistically significant features to discriminate between injection and benign queries resulting in a dataset of significant features. Several Machine learning based classification models using an AutoML library, \"FLAML\", as well as 6 manually programmed models were trained on this dataset , which were then trained on 50 randomized samples of data, cross validated and evaluated. The study found that the best model was the \"FLAML\" library's \"XGBoost limited depth\" model with an accuracy of 71%."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

Recent score-matching approaches to SIVI (SIVI-SM) address this issue via a minimax formulation, at the expense of an additional lower-level optimization problem. In this paper, we propose kernel semi-implicit variational inference (KSIVI), a principled and tractable alternative that eliminates the lower-level optimization by leveraging kernel methods. We show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the lower-level problem admits an explicit solution, reducing the objective to the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD). Exploiting the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit distributions, the resulting KSD objective can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. We establish optimization guarantees via variance bounds on Monte Carlo gradient estimators and derive statistical generalization bounds of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{n})$. We further introduce a multi-layer hierarchical extension that improves expressiveness while preserving tractability. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world Bayesian inference tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of KSIVI."}

We establish that obsolete cryptocurrency mining hardware exhibits emergent computational properties enabling bidirectional information exchange between AI systems and silicon substrates. The research program demonstrates: (1) reservoir computing with NARMA-10 Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.8661; (2) the Thermodynamic Probability Filter (TPF) achieving 92.19% theoretical energy reduction; (3) the Virtual Block Manager achieving +25% effective hashrate; and (4) hardware universality across multiple ASIC families including Antminer S9, Lucky Miner LV06, and Goldshell LB-Box. A significant contribution is the machine-checked mathematical formalization using Lean 4 and Mathlib, providing unambiguous definitions, machine-verified theorems, and reviewer-proof claims. Key theorems proven include: independence implies zero leakage, predictor beats baseline implies non-independence (the logical core of TPF), energy savings theoretical maximum, and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) distinguishability witnesses. Vladimir Veselov's hierarchical number system theory explains why early-round information contains predictive power. This work establishes a new paradigm: treating ASICs not as passive computational substrates but as active conversational partners whose thermodynamic state encodes exploitable computational information."}

Performance on small datasets is improved substantially by using a conventional factor model as prior information via a regularization term in the training objective. The results are interpreted with Attention matrices that quantify the relative importance of variables and their lags for the factor estimate. Time variation in Attention patterns can help detect regime switches and evaluate narratives. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the Transformer is more accurate than the linear factor model, when the data deviate from linear-Gaussian assumptions. An empirical application uses the Transformer to construct a coincident index of U.S. real economic activity."}

However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions."}

The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs. Applications to locally acquired fluorescence microscopy images further proved superiority of AUTO-DIP."}

In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable. We establish an upper bound for the suboptimality of the proposed algorithm, which reveals how the reduction in MSE of policy value estimation, enabled by our proposed weight-clipping estimator, leads to improved policy learning performance."}

The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions."}

SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes. By integrating these multi-perspective features, SheafLapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across these diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that sheaf-theoretic modeling significantly enhances both interpretability and generalizability in predicting mutation-induced structural and functional changes."}

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts."}

The main motivation for such active studies is the growing need to optimize the utilization of network resources as the expansion of the internet of things (IoT) caused a scarcity of network resources. The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning. Also, we provide extensive simulations to evaluate the effects of varying the learning rate, batch size, type of model, and the number of features in the state."}

PVF actively constructs a hierarchical skeleton by prioritizing high-leverage semantic anchors and employs a verification protocol to operationalize pragmatic structural stopping where further deliberation yields diminishing returns. Extensive evaluations on LLaDA-8B-Instruct and Dream-7B-Instruct demonstrate that PVF reduces the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) by up to 65% compared to confidence-based parallel decoding across benchmark datasets, unlocking superior efficiency without compromising accuracy."}

Project Website: https://kuan2jiu99.github.io/AQUA-Bench-demo/", "summary": "Recent advances in audio-aware large language models have shown strong performance on audio question answering. However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding."}

While their capabilities are well-documented, their robustness against adversarial manipulation in competitive ranking scenarios remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we uncover a critical vulnerability in VLM-based product search: multimodal ranking attacks. We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines. These findings reveal that multimodal synergy, typically a strength of VLMs, can be weaponized to compromise the integrity of search rankings without triggering conventional content filters."}

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models.

However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow.

These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research.

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions.

However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset.

DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms.

In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation."}

In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images. Our code is available at https://github.com/qiruo-ya/SDCoNet."}

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance."}

Building on our prior work, this paper introduces SSVD-Outer (SSVD-O), an extension of the structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning method. SSVD-O combines input acoustic feature space-associated inner transformations with output semantic feature space-associated outer transformations to enable scalable and balanced adaptation.

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs.

Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms.

Across closed-form reasoning and open-ended generation tasks, we find that objective choice induces systematic, scale-dependent shifts along the safety-capability frontier. At small training budgets, robustness is similar across objectives but capability differs. At larger budgets, objectives diverge sharply: supervised and preference-based tuning tightly couple capability gains to increased adversarial vulnerability and persona drift, while objectives that constrain learning signals -- especially ORPO and KL-regularization -- substantially mitigate both. Fine-tuning objectives therefore matter little for safety at small scales but become a primary driver of adversarial robustness and latent persona stability as training scale increases."}

We applied several attribution methods, including error maps, saliency maps, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, GradSHAP, and Grad-CAM. Although MAE shows a slightly lower detection, it consistently provides more faithful and temporally precise explanations, suggesting a better alignment with true anomalies.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness.

However, relying on generic distortion metrics fails to capture complex human visual perception, often resulting in blurred or unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we propose Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding (JSCGC), a novel paradigm that shifts the focus from deterministic reconstruction to probabilistic generation. JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods."}

We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination.

To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability."}

To make accessible earlier, authors would like to put it on arxiv before the conference", "summary": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted.

We find that demographic information is distributed across internal units with substantial cross-model variation. Although some units encode sensitive or stereotype-related associations from pretraining, identical demographic cues can induce qualitatively different behaviors. Interventions suppressing such neurons reduce bias but leave substantial residual effects, suggesting behavioral rather than representational change and motivating more systematic mitigation."}

Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches."}

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,δ_i,\\overlineΔ)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $Δ$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable."}

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

We identify the root cause in the neglect of financial asymmetry and rare tail events, which strongly affect market risk but are often overlooked by objectives focusing on distribution matching. To address this, we introduce the Stylized Facts Alignment GAN (SFAG), which converts key stylized facts into differentiable structural constraints and jointly optimizes them with adversarial loss. This multi-constraint design ensures that generated series remain aligned with market dynamics not only in plots but also in backtesting. Experiments on the Shanghai Composite Index (2004--2024) show that while baseline GANs produce unstable and implausible trading outcomes, SFAG generates synthetic data that preserve stylized facts and support robust momentum strategy performance.

Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction.

We introduce Polychronous Wave Computing (PWC), a timing-native address-selection primitive that maps relative spike latencies directly to a discrete output route in the wave domain. Spike times are phase-encoded in a rotating frame and processed by a programmable multiport interferometer that evaluates K template correlations in parallel; a driven--dissipative winner-take-all stage then performs a physical argmax, emitting a one-hot output port. We derive the operating envelope imposed by phase wrapping and mutual coherence, and collapse timing jitter, static phase mismatch, and dephasing into a single effective phase-noise budget whose induced winner--runner-up margin predicts boundary-first failures and provides an intensity-only calibration target. Simulations show that nonlinear competition improves routing fidelity compared with noisy linear intensity readout, and that hardware-in-the-loop phase tuning rescues a temporal-order gate from 55.9% to 97.2% accuracy under strong static mismatch.

To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics.

Instead of repeatedly compiling and executing candidate tests, RM-RF predicts - from source and test code alone - three execution-derived signals: (1) whether the augmented test suite compiles and runs successfully, (2) whether the generated test cases increase code coverage, and (3) whether the generated test cases improve the mutation kill rate. To train and evaluate RM-RF we assemble a multilingual dataset (Java, Python, Go) of focal files, test files, and candidate test additions labeled by an execution-based pipeline, and we release an associated dataset and methodology for comparative evaluation. We tested multiple model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, full fine-tuning, and PEFT via LoRA), achieving an average F1 of 0.69 across the three targets. Compared to conventional compile-and-run instruments, RM-RF provides substantially lower latency and infrastructure cost while delivering competitive predictive fidelity, enabling fast, scalable feedback for large-scale test generation and RL-based code optimization."}

However, a classical limitation of the full conformal framework is the computation of the confidence prediction regions, which is usually impossible since it requires training infinitely many estimators (for real-valued prediction for instance). The main purpose of the present work is to describe a generic strategy for designing a tight approximation to the full conformal prediction region that can be efficiently computed. Along with this approximate confidence region, a theoretical quantification of the tightness of this approximation is developed, depending on the smoothness assumptions on the loss and score functions. The new notion of thickness is introduced for quantifying the discrepancy between the approximate confidence region and the full conformal one."}

Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness."}

Token-oriented methods, such as pruning and skipping, have shown promise in reducing inference latency, but still suffer from inherently limited acceleration potential, outdated proxy signals, and redundancy interference, thus yielding suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose SPTS (Self-Predictive Token Skipping), a training-free framework for efficient long-context LLM inference. Specifically, motivated by the thought of probing the influence of targeted skipping layers, we design two component-specific strategies for selective token skipping: Partial Attention Probing (PAP) for multi-head attention, which selects informative tokens by performing partial forward attention computation, and Low-rank Transformation Probing (LTP) for feed forward network, which constructs a low-rank proxy network to predict token transformations. Furthermore, a Multi-Stage Delayed Pruning (MSDP) strategy reallocates the skipping budget and progressively prunes redundant tokens across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 2.46$\\times$ and 2.29$\\times$ speedups for prefilling and end-to-end generation, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art model performance.

The proposed approach extends applicability to a broader class of $f$-divergences than previously reported and yields theoretical results that recover previously known results. Additionally, the difference between the expected empirical risk of the ERM-$f$DR solution and that of its reference measure is characterized, providing insights into previously studied cases of $f$-divergences. A central contribution is the introduction of the normalization function, a mathematical object that is critical in both the dual formulation and practical computation of the ERM-$f$DR solution. This work presents an implicit characterization of the normalization function as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), establishes its key properties, and subsequently leverages them to construct a numerical algorithm for approximating the normalization factor under mild assumptions. Further analysis demonstrates structural equivalences between ERM-$f$DR problems with different $f$-divergences via transformations of the empirical risk. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to compute the training and test risks of ERM-$f$DR solutions under different $f$-divergence regularizers. This numerical example highlights the practical implications of choosing different functions $f$ in ERM-$f$DR problems."}

We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses. Grounded in the Elements of an Ethic of Care, RubRIX operationalizes five empirically-derived risk dimensions: Inattention, Bias & Stigma, Information Inaccuracy, Uncritical Affirmation, and Epistemic Arrogance. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs on over 20,000 caregiver queries from Reddit and ALZConnected. Rubric-guided refinement consistently reduced risk-components by 45-98% after one iteration across models. This work contributes a methodological approach for developing domain-sensitive, user-centered evaluation frameworks for high-burden contexts. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-sensitive, interactional risk evaluation for the responsible deployment of LLMs in caregiving support contexts.

However, existing domain-specific code benchmarks cannot evaluate the effectiveness of domain specialization methods, which focus on assessing what knowledge LLMs possess rather than how they acquire and apply new knowledge, lacking explicit knowledge corpora for developing domain specialization methods. To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A).

Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal. Best-performing coding agent, Claude Code, achieves only 34.2%, highlighting the urgent need for more effective domain specialization methods.

Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability."}

The system makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce a labeled dataset of 843,000 concept pairs spanning synonymy, antonymy, and co-hyponymy, constructed via Gemini 2.5-Flash LLM augmentation and verified using human-curated dictionary resources. Second, we propose a specialized three-way semantic relation discriminator that achieves 90% macro-F1, enabling robust disambiguation beyond raw embedding similarity. Third, we introduce a novel soft-to-hard clustering algorithm that mitigates semantic drift preventing erroneous transitive chains (e.g., hot -> spicy -> pain -> depression) while simultaneously resolving polysemy. Our approach employs a topology-aware two-stage expansion-pruning procedure with topological voting, ensuring that each term is assigned to exactly one semantically coherent cluster.

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114).

However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments."}

To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue.

In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics. These findings establish that the cost of thought is determined not by task difficulty but by manifold geometry - offering a blueprint for inference acceleration where topology permits."}

While automated jailbreaking methods like GCG [Zou et al., 2023] remain effective, they often require substantial computational resources and specific expertise. We introduce \"sockpuppetting'', a simple method for jailbreaking open-weight LLMs by inserting an acceptance sequence (e.g., \"Sure, here is how to...'') at the start of a model's output and allowing it to complete the response. Requiring only a single line of code and no optimization, sockpuppetting achieves up to 80% higher attack success rate (ASR) than GCG on Qwen3-8B in per-prompt comparisons. We also explore a hybrid approach that optimizes the adversarial suffix within the assistant message block rather than the user prompt, increasing ASR by 64% over GCG on Llama-3.1-8B in a prompt-agnostic setting. The results establish sockpuppetting as an effective low-cost attack accessible to unsophisticated adversaries, highlighting the need for defences against output-prefix injection in open-weight models."}

The main challenge now is to assess the uncertainty of answers, which can help prevent misleading or serious hallucinations for users. Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models.

Despite strong performance, existing confidence estimation methods typically reduce an entire reasoning process to a single scalar score, ignoring how confidence evolves throughout the generation. As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks.

Our results reveal that models are increasingly susceptible to incorrect/misleading endorsements as source expertise increases, with higher-authority sources inducing not only accuracy degradation but also increased confidence in wrong answers.

When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions.

Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution.

At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics.

Computing exact regret is computationally intractable, and current models rely on gradient based optimizers whose outcomes depend heavily on hyperparameter choices. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing methods systematically underestimate actual regret (In some models, the true regret is several hundred times larger than the reported regret), leading to overstated claims of IC and revenue. To address this issue, we derive a lower bound on regret and introduce an efficient item wise regret approximation. Building on this, we propose a guided refinement procedure that substantially improves regret estimation accuracy while reducing computational cost. Our method provides a more reliable foundation for evaluating incentive compatibility in deep learning based auction mechanisms and highlights the need to reassess prior performance claims in this area."}

Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. Our results show that the method successfully achieves uniform acceptance rates and reduces round-trip times across the temperature space.

This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling.

On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness.

In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems.

This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view.

Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring."}

These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research."}

We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method establishes a principled and efficient alternative, reducing latency by up to 2x compared to prior contrastive decoding methods that require multiple forward passes."}

Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a pillar symbolic computation method for reasoning with first-order logic formulas over reals with many applications in formal verification and automatic theorem proving. Variable orderings have a huge impact on its efficiency. Impeded by the difficulty to acquire abundant labelled data, existing learning-based approaches are only competitive with the best expert-based heuristics.

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}

Yet existing detection solutions often exhibit a pronounced deployment gap, with performance degrading sharply when transferred to new sites. This work establishes the foundational detection layer for a multi-year invasive species monitoring initiative targeting Arctic and Atlantic marine ecosystems. We address this challenge by developing a Unified Information Pipeline that standardises heterogeneous datasets into a comparable information flow and evaluates a fixed, deployment-relevant detector under controlled cross-domain protocols. Across multiple domains, we find that structural factors, such as scene composition, object density, and contextual redundancy, explain cross-domain performance loss more strongly than visual degradation such as turbidity, with sparse scenes inducing a characteristic \"Context Collapse\" failure mode. We further validate operational feasibility by benchmarking inference on low-cost edge hardware, showing that runtime optimisation enables practical sampling rates for remote monitoring. The results shift emphasis from image enhancement toward structure-aware reliability, providing a democratised tool for consistent marine ecosystem assessment."}

However, existing approaches often ignore the geometric symmetries of physical environments, leading to redundant behaviors and sample inefficiency. To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline."}

Brain Passage Retrieval (BPR) addresses this by directly mapping EEG signals to passage representations without intermediate text translation. However, existing BPR research exclusively uses visual stimuli, leaving critical questions unanswered: Can auditory EEG enable effective retrieval for voice-based interfaces and visually impaired users? Can training on combined EEG datasets from different sensory modalities improve performance despite severe data scarcity? We present the first systematic investigation of auditory EEG for BPR and evaluate cross-sensory training benefits. Using dual encoder architectures with four pooling strategies (CLS, mean, max, multi-vector), we conduct controlled experiments comparing auditory-only, visual-only, and combined training on the Alice (auditory) and Nieuwland (visual) datasets. Results demonstrate that auditory EEG consistently outperforms visual EEG, and cross-sensory training with CLS pooling achieves substantial improvements over individual training: 31% in MRR (0.474), 43% in Hit@1 (0.314), and 28% in Hit@10 (0.858). Critically, combined auditory EEG models surpass BM25 text baselines (MRR: 0.474 vs 0.428), establishing neural queries as competitive with traditional retrieval whilst enabling accessible interfaces.

Probabilistic forecasts are needed to plan the inventory levels; the predictive distribution should cover non-negative values, have a mass in zero and a long upper tail. Intermittent time series are commonly forecast using local models, which are trained individually on each time series. In the last years global models, which are trained on a large collection of time series, have become popular for time series forecasting. Global models are often based on neural networks. However, they have not yet been exhaustively tested on intermittent time series. We carry out the first study comparing state-of-the-art local (iETS, TweedieGP) and global models (D-Linear, DeepAR, Transformers) on intermittent time series. For neural networks models we consider three different distribution heads suitable for intermittent time series: negative binomial, hurdle-shifted negative binomial and Tweedie. We use, for the first time, the last two distribution heads with neural networks. We perform experiments on five large datasets comprising more than 40'000 real-world time series. Among neural networks D-Linear provides best accuracy; it also consistently outperforms the local models. Moreover, it has also low computational requirements. Transformers-based architectures are instead much more computationally demanding and less accurate. Among the distribution heads, the Tweedie provides the best estimates of the highest quantiles, while the negative binomial offers overall the best performance."}

However, in the non-iid setting, the global model experiences client drift, which can seriously affect the final performance of the model. Previous methods tend to correct the global model that has already deviated based on the loss function or gradient, overlooking the impact of the client samples. In this paper, we rethink the role of the client side and propose Federated Balanced Learning, i.e., FBL, to prevent this issue from the beginning through sample balance on the client side. Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients. Furthermore, we design a Knowledge Alignment Strategy to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, and a Knowledge Drop Strategy to regularize our method. Meanwhile, we scale our method to real and complex scenarios, allowing different clients to adopt various methods, and extend our framework to further improve performance. Numerous experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is released upon acceptance."}

However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions."}

Prior approaches have focused on supervised class-incremental learning, relying on using the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, which is costly, requires human annotation, or is simply not a realistic option. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to address the uVCIL. We first consider a deep feature extractor network, providing a set of representative video features during each task without assuming any class or task information. We then progressively build a series of deep clusters from the extracted features. During the successive task learning, the model updated from the previous task is used as an initial state in order to transfer knowledge to the current learning task. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, by ignoring the labels from the supervised setting.

Transformers self-attention mechanisms have proven valuable for model interpretability, with attention weights successfully used to understand model focus and behavior (Xu et al., 2015); (Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019). However, existing attention-based explanation methods rely on manually defined aggregation strategies and fixed attribution rules (Abnar and Zuidema, 2020a); (Chefer et al., 2021), while model-agnostic approaches (LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and incur significant computational costs through input perturbation. We introduce Explanation Network (ExpNet), a lightweight neural network that learns an explicit mapping from transformer attention patterns to token-level importance scores. Unlike prior methods, ExpNet discovers optimal attention feature combinations automatically rather than relying on predetermined rules. We evaluate ExpNet in a challenging cross-task setting and benchmark it against a broad spectrum of model-agnostic methods and attention-based techniques spanning four methodological families."}

Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig.
