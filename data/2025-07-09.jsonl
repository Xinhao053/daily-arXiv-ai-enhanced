Working paper (1st full draft); typos may exist", "summary": "In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms\ngenerate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared\nto the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being\nconsistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be\nimproved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in\nfeature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial\ndependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar\neffects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are\ncommonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,\nwithout any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that\neventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing\nportfolio.\n  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'\nreturns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as\nan independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such\na stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary\nprocesses fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a\nstrategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,\nmatching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly\ncriterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the\ntheoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as\nlong as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the\ngeneralized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms\nthe broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts."}

In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically\nconsist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the\ngenerated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,\na Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a\nsource mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and\ndischarge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content.

These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,\nmodels downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,\nhighlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new\ninsights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the\ncritical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization."}

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the\nsuperiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to\ngenerate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's\nfirst language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this\nresearch has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,\nrather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel\ncross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence\nbased on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We\nevaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,\ncomparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated\napproaches.

For depth functions dependent on unknown\ndistributions, we offer asymptotic guarantees using non-parametric statistical\nmethods. In contrast to plain-vanilla Monte Carlo methodology the number of\nsamples required in the algorithm is random but typically much smaller than\nstandard choices suggested in the literature. The seMCD method can be applied\nto various depth functions, covering multivariate and functional spaces. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency and reliability of our approach through empirical\nstudies, highlighting its applicability in outlier or anomaly detection,\nclassification, and depth region computation. In conclusion, the\nseMCD-algorithm can achieve accurate depth approximations with few Monte Carlo\nsamples while maintaining rigorous statistical guarantees."}

One of the most effective\napproaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.\nHowever, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a\nsingle generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have\nbeen introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision\niterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a\nresource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage\nhigh-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation\ncapabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a\ndegradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed\nto enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of\nthe generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user\ninstructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,\nand applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by\nselective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving\nimprovements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,\nenabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative\nrefinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves\ninstruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data\ngenerated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of\ndata while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the\nnon-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and\neffective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external\nsupervision."}

In the\nabsence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from\nthe available observational data. However, observational data are often\ncompatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single\nstructure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural\nuncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior\ndistribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.\nUnfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with\nthe number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose\nto circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end\nmodel: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process\n(MACE-TNP).

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's\nprediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in\nthe last layer."}

Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical\nsuccess across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the\ngeneralization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring\neither graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the\nfirst learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping\nconnections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ngeneralization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest\nachievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the\nproposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification\nmaintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges\nthat support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections\nlead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a\ntwo-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified\nmatrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of\njumping connections' role in sparsification requirements.

A challenge, however, is the\neffective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is\nhindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their\ninherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in\nsitu optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the\nphysical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by\nslow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited\nmeasurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning\napproach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training\nof diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement\ndata and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster\nconvergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ\nlearning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,\nholographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image\nclassification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.\nOur strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts\nfor unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system\nknowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under\nrealistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning\napproach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical\nsystems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics."}

However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured\nLAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in\nmanaging the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the\nsophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This\narticle highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust\nquantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically\nconsiders varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load\nbalancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent\nclient-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global\nexpert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these\nsystemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training\nmechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way\nfor the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in\nedge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency."}

Although\ndomain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting\nlow-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such\nas tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,\ncreating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In\nthis work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton\nprogramming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming\nexpertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based\nreward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming\nability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of\nTritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves\nperformance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet\nand DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial\nrole of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,\nand the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for\nautomatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance\nkernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an\nimportant foundation for building more efficient AI systems.

This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained\nwith diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied\nindividual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems\ndescribed above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the\nresidual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble\ncan be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled\nconcatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This\nis also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and\nto directly compare them with CLIP in this setting."}

From a data-centric\nperspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation\nas a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a\n\"synthetic\" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original\ndataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced\ncost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate\ndataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on\ntraining discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a\nnovel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two\nphases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse\nsubset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach\nphase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual\nrepresentations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments\nacross various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that\nour D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with\ndramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the\nSiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID\nscore of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data."}

This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine\nauscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on\nclassification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.\nTo evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple\nexpert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated\nregarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous\nMitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of\n70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset.

The investigation encompassed training and evaluating\nthree classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While\nAdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost\ndemonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms\nshowed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied\nlabel noise reduction, most notably XGBoost.

To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding\n(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free\nself-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance\nmetacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the\ngeometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant\nreasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to\nrepetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration.

The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the\nsuperiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training."}

The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto\ncoherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,\nmissing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,\nsuggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our\nmethod by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known\nsuperconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the\nsuperconducting TMD clusters.

In\nthis work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton\nprogramming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming\nexpertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based\nreward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming\nability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of\nTritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves\nperformance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet\nand DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial\nrole of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,\nand the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for\nautomatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance\nkernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an\nimportant foundation for building more efficient AI systems.

A sliding window technique is\nemployed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized\nflare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare\nactivity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class\nimbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on\nsequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while\nLSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding\nwindows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval.

Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy\ncolon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32\ndistinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation\nlearning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.\nWe leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision\n(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that\nour dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential\nbiomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues\naffected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that\nconfirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development.

To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce\nHRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning\ntechniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)\nand a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al.

Grid-, neighborhood-, and\nobject-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and\nhigher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain\nsharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.\nWhile GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for\nfuture graph-based forecasting.
