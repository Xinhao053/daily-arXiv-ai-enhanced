Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and\nTensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in\nCartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined\ntensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments\ninto a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring\nsymmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and\nequivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal\nembeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets,\ncharges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control\nover external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range\ninteractions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation\nmodule within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet\ncomputationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We\ndemonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with\nor surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and\nextended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra,\nhessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems,\nmulti-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems.

However,\nin online or streaming settings where data arrive one sample at a time, the\nclassical TERM objective degenerates to standard ERM, losing tilt sensitivity.\nWe address this limitation by proposing an online TERM formulation that removes\nthe logarithm from the classical objective, preserving tilt effects without\nadditional computational or memory overhead. This formulation enables a\ncontinuous trade-off controlled by $t$, smoothly interpolating between ERM ($t\n\\to 0$), fairness emphasis ($t > 0$), and robustness to outliers ($t < 0$). We\nempirically validate online TERM on two representative streaming tasks: robust\nlinear regression with adversarial outliers and minority-class detection in\nbinary classification.

Through\nrigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning\nnegative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration\nmethods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a\nmethodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:\nnegative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while\ndestroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to\nescape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE\nless than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize\nthis as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot\ndistinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60\npercent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent\nconfident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure\nrate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while\npost-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our\ntheorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.\nThis impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and\nestablishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely\nconvenient.

Yet, in modern\nmachine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can\nhelp improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable\nmodel of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data\ncoarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics,\nwe analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based\non their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic\ndependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A\n'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can\nhelp models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates\nout more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially,\nusing optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a\ndistinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent.\nOur framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data\naugmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and\nisolates more predictive signals.

A\nsubset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an\nongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix\nprediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the\nend timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,\nwhere we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy\nperforming work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes\nconsisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the\nproposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of\neach activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how\nbusy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,\nwherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in\nlockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An\nevaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of\ndifferent instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a\nmulti-model approach to case suffix prediction."}

However,\nexisting LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with\nhigh-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the\ndata's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for\nHigh-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates\ndirectly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT\npreserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and\nsecond-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,\nand it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),\nhigher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An\nalternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to\nefficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core\ntensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information\nof high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved\nclassification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,\nimages and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior\nclassification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and\nprior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker\nMachines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest\naccuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation.

However,\nconventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific\nsupervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and\ngeneralization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit\nthe goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and\nthen a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those\ntraditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this\noptimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC)\nvia optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and\narchitecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph\ndiffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability\nof the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty\nof node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan\nand representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic\nconsistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing\ngraph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation\nof condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic\nharmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic\nassociations through the optimized representation transport plan in\npre-training.

For a particular signal decay, the process\nfor ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed\nanalysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic\noverlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the\nsimulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process\ntypically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic\nmethod exists.\n  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,\nwe present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to\novercome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the\ncritical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements.

However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the\nendogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure\naccurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)\nprovides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting\naccuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous\nvariables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage\nfuture exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal\nrelationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their\nperformance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous\nvariables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework\nDAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel\ndimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,\nwe first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal\ndiscovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future\nexogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module\nthat incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of\nforecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous\nvariables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar\ndesign principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical\nexogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal\ninjection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the\nprediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables."}

Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to\ncombine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both\nmodalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs),\ninevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly\nfine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a\ntraining-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing\npretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight\n2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path\n(either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair,\neffectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In\naddition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration\nby analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the\nbest result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids\nthe prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven\nbenchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance\namong open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of\n4.02%.

In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically\npreserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private,\nwhereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling.\nIn this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on\nthe social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data\nsharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of\nlimited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource\nallocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy\nconsumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce\nthe concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate.\nWe analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model\nperformance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization\nproblem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary\nexperimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with\nMobility (DO-SNM) algorithm.

As the need for intelligence\ngrows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world.

Integrated Sensing and\nCommunication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.\nWithin ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses\nwireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with\nexisting communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are\nlimited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum\naccuracy reachable.

To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of\nEnvironment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment\nshifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of\nEnvironment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that\nprioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.\nDEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies\ndistinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more\nsample-efficient learning.

Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches\nbased on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness\nand scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models\ncan effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates\nunsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting.

Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning\nstage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage\npost-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral\ncloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,\nSelf-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a\nwell-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of\nrobots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human\nsupervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot\nembodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on\nEmbodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT\nand Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling\nimitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to\npolicies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight\nthat the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key\nto this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination\nuniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously\npracticing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors\nobserved in the imitation learning datasets used during training.

Several\nrecent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different\nparameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while\nsignificantly reducing computational demands.

In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions\nand a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize\nmixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on\nRISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software\nco-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a\ncombination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level\noptimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance\nthe ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for\nweights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while\nimplementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we\nintegrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and\na greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal\nmixed-quantized models.

Our analysis extends to the practical aspects\nof these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands\nalongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the\nselection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for\nreal-world applications."}

While most prior work assumes a known causal\nmodel, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional\nconstraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute\nrelationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design\nefficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong\nassumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To\nensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of\nlow-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,\ncomplemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated\ncomputational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the\nconventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off\nrelationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions."}

Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization.\nTools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook\nvaluable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also\nimpractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in\ncommercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges,\nwe propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is\ncapable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets\nfor training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates\ndata that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic\nand phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while\ngenerating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables\nscalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity,\nnormalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets."}

The architecture employs a flexible, data-driven design, while the\ncompiler uses a constrained programming approach to optimize compute and data\nmovement based on workload characteristics. Compared to the leading embedded\nNPU and compiler stack, our solution achieves an average speedup of 1.8x (4x\npeak) at equal TOPS and memory resources across standard AI-benchmarks. Even\nagainst NPUs with double the compute and memory resources, Neutron delivers up\nto 3.3x higher performance."}

Our\napproach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention,\nrotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four\ndownstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT,\nconsistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out\nof four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline\nPatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and\nMosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the\ntokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all\nModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of\nPatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications.\nThese results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and\narchitectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks."}

However, we\nidentify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window\nproblem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become\nirrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address\nthis issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and\nbidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To\novercome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based\nmethod that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to\nbetter fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based\nFine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at\npositions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on\nopen-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM\nbaselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works,\ndemonstrating both speed and quality improvements."}

A key\nelement in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which\ncharacterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given\nspace. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using\ncontext information collected from the environment, such as scene images.\nHowever, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric\ninformation from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural\nimplicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural\nAcoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and\nextracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.\nOur approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features\ncan better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR\npredictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various\nevaluation metrics. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of MiNAF in datasets\nwith limited training samples, demonstrating an advance in high-fidelity sound\nsimulation."}

Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution\nscenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of\n$2.8\\%\\text{-}4.8\\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks\nwith non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with\n$2.4\\%\\text{-}3.9\\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks\nin MMMU."}

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free\nobservational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight\nobjects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera\ncoverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised\ntrajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark.
