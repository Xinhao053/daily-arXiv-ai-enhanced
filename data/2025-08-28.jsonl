This perspective paper provides an integrated perspective on\ngenerative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and\nthermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate\nthat the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the\ngenerative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the\nscore function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the\nbranching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as\nsymmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis\noffers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by\nthe controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks\nin information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible\noutcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates\nthe bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible\nwith the data."}

This limitation\nmakes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as\nthey must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A\ncentral challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert\ndemonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that\nincorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve\nRL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From\nAssociative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL\npolicy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory\nBuffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset.\nDuring training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data\nfrom the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and\nintegrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation.\nThis requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone\narchitecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories\n(0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a\nstrong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up\nto +10.7 normalized points.

A\nsuccessful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have\nsome knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from,\nand this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference\nsamples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the\nattacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample\ncomplexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful\nattack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean\nestimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate\n$\\hat\\mu$ up to some error $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat \\mu - \\mu\\|^2_{\\Sigma}]\\leq\n\\rho^2 d$.

We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the\nfirst framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node\nclassification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization\nand graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar\nlabels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases\nmemorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less\nhomophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the\nincreased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'\nimplicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily\nregimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the\nnode labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher\nlabel inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more\nprone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph\nhomophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to\nmitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively\nreduces memorization without compromising model performance.

In particular, LLMs are\nincreasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating\npredictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or\nsupervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised\nlearning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially\nexplains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also\nconsider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained\nspecifically for data fitting.

For example, predicting room congestion from CO2 levels achieves\nnear-perfect accuracy but is unsurprising.

In\nthis study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR\nIntervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for\npositional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early\nprediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise\ntesting results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of\n0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932. Additionally, our\nmethod demonstrates high computational efficiency, with only 73.5 thousand\nparameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural\nNetwork-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) approaches in both accuracy and\nmodel compactness. Notably, the model can predict AF up to two hours in advance\nusing just 30 minutes of input data, providing enough lead time for preventive\ninterventions."}

However, exact conditional simulation from this\npredictive distribution is intractable or inefficient for many spatial process\nmodels. In this paper, we propose neural conditional simulation (NCS), a\ngeneral method for spatial conditional simulation that is based on neural\ndiffusion models. Specifically, using spatial masks, we implement a conditional\nscore-based diffusion model that evolves Gaussian noise into samples from a\npredictive distribution when given a partially observed spatial field and\nspatial process parameters as inputs. The diffusion model relies on a neural\nnetwork that only requires unconditional samples from the spatial process for\ntraining. Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to the\nobservations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of those\nobservations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used to\nconditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions without\nretraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations against\nsimulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model,\nand against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnick\nprocess model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is more\nefficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMC\ntechniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enables\nefficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictive\ndistributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods."}

Predicting\nbehavior in this setting relies on high-fidelity physics-based simulations that\nare computationally expensive. Yet, the uncertain, heterogeneous properties\nthat control these flows make it necessary to perform many of these expensive\nsimulations, which is often prohibitive. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a physics-informed machine learning workflow that couples a fully\ndifferentiable multiphase flow simulator, which is implemented in the DPFEHM\nframework with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN learns to predict\nfluid extraction rates from heterogeneous permeability fields to enforce\npressure limits at critical reservoir locations. By incorporating transient\nmultiphase flow physics into the training process, our method enables more\npractical and accurate predictions for realistic injection-extraction scenarios\ncompare to previous works. To speed up training, we pretrain the model on\nsingle-phase, steady-state simulations and then fine-tune it on full multiphase\nscenarios, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate\nthat high-accuracy training can be achieved with fewer than three thousand\nfull-physics multiphase flow simulations -- compared to previous estimates\nrequiring up to ten million.

A\nsuccessful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have\nsome knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from,\nand this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference\nsamples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the\nattacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample\ncomplexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful\nattack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean\nestimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate\n$\\hat\\mu$ up to some error $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat \\mu - \\mu\\|^2_{\\Sigma}]\\leq\n\\rho^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting,\n$\\Omega(n + n^2 \\rho^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that\ncompetes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that\nthe attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses\nto train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as\nall attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples\nand cannot benefit from $\\omega(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be\nunderestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may\nbe possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain."}

In particular, LLMs are\nincreasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating\npredictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or\nsupervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised\nlearning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially\nexplains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also\nconsider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained\nspecifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve\nprediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant\nvariations.

While Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n(SAM) has proven effective in improving generalization by seeking flat minima,\nits substantial extra memory and computation overhead make it impractical for\nlarge models. Integrating SAM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a promising direction. However, we find that\ndirectly applying SAM to LoRA parameters limits the sharpness optimization to a\nrestricted subspace, hindering its effectiveness. To address this limitation,\nwe propose Bi-directional Low-Rank Adaptation (Bi-LoRA), which introduces an\nauxiliary LoRA module to model SAM's adversarial weight perturbations. It\ndecouples SAM's weight perturbations from LoRA optimization: the primary LoRA\nmodule adapts to specific tasks via standard gradient descent, while the\nauxiliary module captures the sharpness of the loss landscape through gradient\nascent. Such dual-module design enables Bi-LoRA to capture broader sharpness\nfor achieving flatter minima while remaining memory-efficient. Another\nimportant benefit is that the dual design allows for simultaneous optimization\nand perturbation, eliminating SAM's doubled training costs. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse tasks and architectures demonstrate Bi-LoRA's\nefficiency and effectiveness in enhancing generalization."}

Here, we present a\ncounterfactual reward model that introduces causal inference with multimodal\nrepresentation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward\nsignal. The heart of our contribution is the Counterfactual Trust Score, an\naggregated score consisting of four components: (1) counterfactual shifts that\ndecompose political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction\nuncertainty during counterfactual perturbations; (3) demonstrable violations of\nfairness rules for each protected attribute; and (4) temporal reward shifts\naligned with dynamic trust measures. We evaluated the framework on a multimodal\nfake versus true news dataset, which exhibits framing bias, class imbalance,\nand distributional drift. Following methodologies similar to unsupervised drift\ndetection from representation-based distances [1] and temporal robustness\nbenchmarking in language models [2], we also inject synthetic bias across\nsequential batches to test robustness. The resulting system achieved an\naccuracy of 89.12% in fake news detection, outperforming the baseline reward\nmodels.

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones. The implementation is publicly\navailable at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/SyReM."}

The\nformer, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's\nperformance.

This\nparadigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective\nallocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the\nagent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose\nReinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that\ndecouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective\noptimization of the planning module.

Meanwhile,\nsimilarity-based methods can be computationally expensive and domain-specific,\nlimiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors\nin Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves\nricher information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on\ntheoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the\naggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the\npredictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an\nanchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in\nlogit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle\nvariations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate\nperformance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts.

To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework\nbased on visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we formulate instance-wise prompt\ngeneration from a Bayesian perspective and model the prompt posterior as an\nimplicit distribution to capture diverse visual semantics. We derive a\nvariational training objective under the semi-implicit variational inference\nframework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\npFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing pFL methods under both feature\nand label heterogeneity settings."}

Recent\ndata-centric methods like pruning and compression aim to optimize training but\noffer limited theoretical insight into how data properties affect\ngeneralization, especially the data characteristics in sample scaling.\nTraditional perspectives further constrain progress by focusing predominantly\non data quantity and training efficiency, often overlooking structural aspects\nof data quality. In this study, we introduce SCAR, a principled scheme for\ncharacterizing the intrinsic structural properties of datasets across four key\nmeasures: Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, and Richness. Unlike prior\ndata-centric measures, SCAR captures stable characteristics that remain\ninvariant under dataset scaling, providing a robust and general foundation for\ndata understanding. Leveraging these structural properties, we introduce\nFoundation Data-a minimal subset that preserves the generalization behavior of\nthe full dataset without requiring model-specific retraining. We model\nsingle-modality tasks as step functions and estimate the distribution of the\nfoundation data size to capture step-wise generalization bias across modalities\nin the target multi-modal dataset. Finally, we develop a SCAR-guided data\ncompletion strategy based on this generalization bias, which enables efficient,\nmodality-aware expansion of modality-specific characteristics in multimodal\ndatasets. Experiments across diverse multi-modal datasets and model\narchitectures validate the effectiveness of SCAR in predicting data utility and\nguiding data acquisition.

To train the ORMs we mainly\ngenerate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors\ncovered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo\ngeneration technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect\nassumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering\npreviously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain\nerrors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers\nthe model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and\necho-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic,\nand ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs."}

This is especially true during initialization phase, which\ndominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and\nassociated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative\npipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily\nlarge granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic\nconfigurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling\ntask, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to\ngenerate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D\ninpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs,\nstitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples\nwith physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several\nmasking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the\nnetwork to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised\ntensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a\n2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground\ntruth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted\nlosses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both\nmodels are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from\nsmall-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time\nwith respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track\nsynthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20\nseconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain\ngeometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent,\nreal-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications."}

In\nthis work, we explore a different goal: building classifiers that are\ninteresting. An ``interesting classifier'' is one that uses unusual or\nunexpected features, even if its accuracy is lower than the best possible\nmodel. For example, predicting room congestion from CO2 levels achieves\nnear-perfect accuracy but is unsurprising. In contrast, predicting room\ncongestion from humidity is less accurate yet more nuanced and intriguing. We\nintroduce EUREKA, a simple framework that selects features according to their\nperceived interestingness. Our method leverages large language models to rank\nfeatures by their interestingness and then builds interpretable classifiers\nusing only the selected interesting features. Across several benchmark\ndatasets, EUREKA consistently identifies features that are non-obvious yet\nstill predictive. For example, in the Occupancy Detection dataset, our method\nfavors humidity over CO2 levels and light intensity, producing classifiers that\nachieve meaningful accuracy while offering insights. In the Twin Papers\ndataset, our method discovers the rule that papers with a colon in the title\nare more likely to be cited in the future.

However, mainstream approaches\ngenerally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation\nrules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural\nheterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to\nover-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network\nframework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity\nGraph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory\nand designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that\nsimultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the\nstability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable\nparameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on\ncomplex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both\nstructure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving\nadaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on\neight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation\nnetwork, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging\nconditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer.\nThis work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the\ndesign of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the\nimportance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation\nlearning.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates\nneuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1\nextends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy\nobjective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser\nthat aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding\nconvolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and\n(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style\nconsolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the\nnetwork. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,\nexplicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins\nin the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet\nacross five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,\nDenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other\nmethods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp\n(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual\nInformation (NMI) increased by up to +0.15.

Paper accepted to CIKM 2025", "summary": "Given a signed bipartite graph (SBG) G with two disjoint node sets U and V,\nthe goal of link sign prediction is to predict the signs of potential links\nconnecting U and V based on known positive and negative edges in G. The\nmajority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on\nunipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node\nheterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent\nstudies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing\nschemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node\npairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were\noriginally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not\noptimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in\nSBGs.\n  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective\nspectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs.\nIn particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive\naccuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically\ngrounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization;\n(ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and\n(iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating\nGegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive\nempirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior\nperformance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign\nprediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets."}

Central to\nour work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic\nstandardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained\nexpert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process,\nenabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive\nexperiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs\nexhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap\ncompared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that\ncognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity.\nHowever, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas\nhuman correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern\ncomplexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations\nin current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable\ninsights for advancing model design."}

Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile\nphones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work\nquantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability\nthrough such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street\nparking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem,\nwe analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn),\ncoordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized\noracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our\nnovel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior\nprobabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of\nhow close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to\nnavigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical\ndistances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a\nHungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity\nsimulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of\nCord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes\nfor non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx\nreduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,\nand up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users."}

For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval)\nthat measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user\nrequest is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current\nopen- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and\nthat, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve\nperformance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak\nconfidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces\nshould be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty\nof our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure\nthrough various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn\nconversations where password verification is more challenging.

Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning.

As with any critical\nsafety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service\ndisruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary\ninterruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work\nrelies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal.\nThis not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing,\nbut it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and\noperational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance\nrecords, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source\nissues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern\nof PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM\nmovement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only\none input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to\nclassify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving\n>99.99\\% precision, <0.01\\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our\nmethodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on\nseveral electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench\nenvironments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a\nclear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence\nlayer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359\nstandard."}

While\nconventional anonymization techniques can remove explicit identifiers, such\nremoval may result in performance drop in downstream machine learning tasks.\nMore importantly, simple anonymization may not be effective against inference\nattacks that exploit implicit signals such as writing style, topical focus, or\ndemographic cues, highlighting the need for more robust privacy safeguards\nduring model training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user\nprivacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that\nfine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that\njointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and\noutput diversity.
