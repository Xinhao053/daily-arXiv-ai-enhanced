The Local Volatility (LV) model\ndistinguishes itself from other pricing models by its ability to match\nobservable market prices across all strikes and maturities with high accuracy.\nHowever, LV calibration is fundamentally ill-posed: finite market observables\nmust determine a continuously-defined surface with infinite local volatility\nparameters. This ill-posed nature often causes spiky LV surfaces that are\nparticularly problematic for finite-difference-based valuation, and induces\nhigh-frequency oscillations in solutions, thus leading to unstable Greeks. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a pre-calibration smoothing method that can\nbe integrated seamlessly into any LV calibration workflow. Our method\npre-processes market observables using local regression that automatically\nminimizes asymptotic conditional mean squared error to generate denoised inputs\nfor subsequent LV calibration. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed pre-calibration smoothing yields significantly smoother LV surfaces\nand greatly improves Greek stability for exotic options with negligible\nadditional computational cost, while preserving the LV model's ability to fit\nmarket observables with high fidelity."}

OBI is positively\ncorrelated with returns, and some investors try to use it to improve\nperformance. Large orders placed at once can reveal intent, invite\nfront-running, raise volatility, and cause losses. Execution algorithms\ntherefore split parent orders into smaller lots to limit price distortion. In\nprinciple, using OBI inside such algorithms could improve execution, but prior\nevidence is scarce because isolating OBI's effect in real markets is nearly\nimpossible amid many external factors.\n  Multi-agent simulation offers a way to study this. In an artificial market,\nindividual actors are agents whose rules and interactions form the model. This\nstudy builds an execution algorithm that accounts for OBI, tests it across\nseveral market patterns in artificial markets, and analyzes mechanisms,\ncomparing it with a conventional (OBI-agnostic) algorithm.\n  Results: (i) In stable markets, the OBI strategy's performance depends on the\nnumber of order slices; outcomes vary with how the parent order is partitioned.\n(ii) In markets with unstable prices, the OBI-based algorithm outperforms the\nconventional approach. (iii) Under spoofing manipulation, the OBI strategy is\nnot significantly worse than the conventional algorithm, indicating limited\nvulnerability to spoofing.\n  Overall, OBI provides a useful signal for execution. Incorporating OBI can\nadd value - especially in volatile conditions - while remaining reasonably\nrobust to spoofing; in calm markets, benefits are sensitive to slicing design."}

We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical\ncommunication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into\ntask-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two\ntheoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth\nvariation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic\ndecay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under\nrealistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated\nlayers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally\nencourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by\nthese insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as\na lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy\nimprovements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies\ninformation-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling\nexplicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy\ndeviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection\nbenchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss\nconsistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically\nenhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up\nto two orders of magnitude.

This paper investigates such limitations in the\ncontext of hierarchical retrieval (HR), where the document set has a\nhierarchical structure and the matching documents for a query are all of its\nancestors. We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding\ndimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number\nof documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a\nstandard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and\ndocument pairs.

We additionally contribute to a growing body of literature\ndocumenting the relationship between perception of crime and actual crime rates\nby separately analyzing how the physical urban landscape shapes subjective\nfeelings of safety. Our results are twofold. First, in consensus with prior\nwork, we demonstrate a \"broken windows\" effect in which abandoned buildings, a\nsign of social disorder, are associated with both greater incidence of crime\nand a heightened perception of danger.

To address this, we introduce FairTune, a bias-aware\nfine-tuning framework in which we benchmark three mitigation strategies: class\nweighting based on inverse group frequency (IF), Group Distributionally Robust\nOptimization (GroupDRO), and adversarial debiasing (ADV). We find that IF and\nGroupDRO significantly reduce fairness gaps without compromising accuracy, with\neffectiveness varying by deployment domain.

In a\ntypical SS setting, there is a much larger-sized unlabeled data, containing\nonly observations of predictors, and a moderately sized labeled data containing\nobservations for both an outcome and the set of predictors. Such data naturally\narises when the outcome, unlike the predictors, is costly or difficult to\nobtain. One of the primary statistical objectives in SS settings is to explore\nwhether parameter estimation can be improved by exploiting the unlabeled data.\nWe propose a novel Bayesian method for estimating the population mean in SS\nsettings. The approach yields estimators that are both efficient and optimal\nfor estimation and inference. The method itself has several interesting\nartifacts. The central idea behind the method is to model certain summary\nstatistics of the data in a targeted manner, rather than the entire raw data\nitself, along with a novel Bayesian notion of debiasing. Specifying appropriate\nsummary statistics crucially relies on a debiased representation of the\npopulation mean that incorporates unlabeled data through a flexible nuisance\nfunction while also learning its estimation bias. Combined with careful usage\nof sample splitting, this debiasing approach mitigates the effect of bias due\nto slow rates or misspecification of the nuisance parameter from the posterior\nof the final parameter of interest, ensuring its robustness and efficiency.\nConcrete theoretical results, via Bernstein--von Mises theorems, are\nestablished, validating all claims, and are further supported through extensive\nnumerical studies.

Numerous attacks exist\nacross different threat models, each with distinct implementations targeting\nvarious sources of privacy leakage, making them difficult to apply\nconsistently. Moreover, no single attack consistently outperforms the others,\nleading to a routine underestimation of privacy risk.\n  To address these issues, we propose a unified, model-agnostic threat\nframework that deploys a collection of attacks to estimate the maximum\nempirical privacy leakage in synthetic datasets.

To appear as an Oral\n  presentation in the proceedings of the Main Conference on Empirical Methods\n  in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2025", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on\nmedical benchmarks; however, their ability to perform medical calculations, a\ncrucial aspect of clinical decision-making, remains underexplored and poorly\nevaluated. Existing benchmarks often assess only the final answer with a wide\nnumerical tolerance, overlooking systematic reasoning failures and potentially\ncausing serious clinical misjudgments. In this work, we revisit medical\ncalculation evaluation with a stronger focus on clinical trustworthiness.\nFirst, we clean and restructure the MedCalc-Bench dataset and propose a new\nstep-by-step evaluation pipeline that independently assesses formula selection,\nentity extraction, and arithmetic computation. Under this granular framework,\nthe accuracy of GPT-4o drops from 62.7% to 43.6%, revealing errors masked by\nprior evaluations. Second, we introduce an automatic error analysis framework\nthat generates structured attribution for each failure mode. Human evaluation\nconfirms its alignment with expert judgment, enabling scalable and explainable\ndiagnostics. Finally, we propose a modular agentic pipeline, MedRaC, that\ncombines retrieval-augmented generation and Python-based code execution.\nWithout any fine-tuning, MedRaC improves the accuracy of different LLMs from\n16.35% up to 53.19%. Our work highlights the limitations of current benchmark\npractices and proposes a more clinically faithful methodology. By enabling\ntransparent and transferable reasoning evaluation, we move closer to making\nLLM-based systems trustworthy for real-world medical applications."}

This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework\nthat addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative\nlinchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global\nlatent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level\nlatent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics\ndirectly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from\nopinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of\ninteracting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a\nconvergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's\ninfluence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables\na principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded\ndiagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster\nfunctional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to\nsignificantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By\nunifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted\nin multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and\ncontrollable approach to transformer-based generation."}

Without\ninformation retrieval techniques, this task is impossible due to the vast and\nexpanding literature. Objective: Building on prior work, this study evaluates\nan information retrieval-driven workflow to enhance the efficiency,\ntransparency, and reproducibility of systematic reviews. We use endometriosis\nrecurrence as an ideal case due to its complex and ambiguous literature.\nMethods: Our hybrid approach integrates PRISMA guidelines with computational\ntechniques. We applied semi-automated deduplication to efficiently filter\nrecords before manual screening. This workflow synthesized evidence from\nrandomised controlled trials on the efficacy of a subclass of\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH'as). A modified splitting method\naddressed unit-of-analysis errors in multi-arm trials. Results: Our workflow\nefficiently reduced the screening workload. It took only 11 days to fetch and\nfilter 812 records. Seven RCTs were eligible, providing evidence from 841\npatients in 4 countries. The pooled random-effects model yielded a Risk Ratio\n(RR) of 0.64 (95% CI (0.48 to 0.86)), with non-significant heterogeneity\n($I^2=0.00\\%$, $\\tau=0.00$); i.e., a 36% reduction in endometriosis recurrence.\nSensitivity analyses and bias assessments supported the robustness of our\nfindings.

When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in\nstate and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been\nproposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In\nparticular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents\ncooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on\nlocal state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may\nbecome a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents\nis crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in\nPDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a\ndecentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional,\nparametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to\neffectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect\nto the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by\nsinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control\nproblems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can\neffectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents,\noutperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal\nwith parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and\n(iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of\n~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on\ncomputationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating\nthe dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance."}

Multicalibration is a\nstrengthening of calibration which requires that predictors be calibrated on a\npotentially overlapping collection of subsets of the domain. As\nmulticalibration grows in popularity with practitioners, an essential question\nis: how do we measure how multicalibrated a predictor is? B{\\l}asiok et al.\n(2023) considered this question for standard calibration by introducing the\ndistance to calibration framework (dCE) to understand how calibration metrics\nrelate to each other and the ground truth. Building on the dCE framework, we\nconsider the auditability of the distance to multicalibration of a predictor\n$f$.\n  We begin by considering two natural generalizations of dCE to multiple\nsubgroups: worst group dCE (wdMC), and distance to multicalibration (dMC). We\nargue that there are two essential properties of any multicalibration error\nmetric: 1) the metric should capture how much $f$ would need to be modified in\norder to be perfectly multicalibrated; and 2) the metric should be auditable in\nan information theoretic sense. We show that wdMC and dMC each fail to satisfy\none of these two properties, and that similar barriers arise when considering\nthe auditability of general distance to multigroup fairness notions. We then\npropose two (equivalent) multicalibration metrics which do satisfy these\nrequirements: 1) a continuized variant of dMC; and 2) a distance to\nintersection multicalibration, which leans on intersectional fairness\ndesiderata. Along the way, we shed light on the loss-landscape of distance to\nmulticalibration and the geometry of the set of perfectly multicalibrated\npredictors. Our findings may have implications for the development of stronger\nmulticalibration algorithms as well as multigroup auditing more generally."}

Unlike existing embeddings (such as persistence images,\nlandscapes, or kernel methods), persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous\nmapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein\ndistance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a\ntheoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making\npersistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the\nWasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. We derive explicit formulas for\npersistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and\nparallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse\nregression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series,\ngraphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres\nconsistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to\npersistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel."}

We introduce LifeAlign,\na novel framework for lifelong alignment that enables LLMs to maintain\nconsistent human preference alignment across sequential learning tasks without\nforgetting previously learned knowledge. Our approach consists of two key\ninnovations. First, we propose a focalized preference optimization strategy\nthat aligns LLMs with new preferences while preventing the erosion of knowledge\nacquired from previous tasks. Second, we develop a short-to-long memory\nconsolidation mechanism that merges denoised short-term preference\nrepresentations into stable long-term memory using intrinsic dimensionality\nreduction, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of alignment patterns\nacross diverse domains. We evaluate LifeAlign across multiple sequential\nalignment tasks spanning different domains and preference types. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in\nmaintaining both preference alignment quality and knowledge retention compared\nto existing lifelong learning approaches. The codes and datasets will be\nreleased on GitHub."}

To\ndeal with this, real-time fraud detection is essential for financial security\nbut remains challenging due to high transaction volumes and the complexity of\nmodern fraud patterns. This study presents a comprehensive performance\ncomparison between traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM,\nLogistic Regression, XGBoost, and ensemble methods like Stacking and Voting\nClassifier for detecting credit card fraud on a heavily imbalanced public\ndataset, where the number of fraudulent transactions is 492 out of 284,807\ntotal transactions. Application-specific preprocessing techniques were applied,\nand the models were evaluated using various performance metrics. The ensemble\nmethods achieved an almost perfect precision of around 0.99, but traditional\nmethods demonstrated superior performance in terms of recall, which highlights\nthe trade-off between false positives and false negatives. The comprehensive\ncomparison reveals distinct performance strengths and limitations for each\nalgorithm, offering insights to guide practitioners in selecting the most\neffective model for robust fraud detection applications in real-world settings."}

Recent\nadvances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract\nmeaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are\noften missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of\npatients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations\ncan be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or\nradiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by\nclinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality\nmissing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation\nlearning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in\nmultimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion\ncomponent that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning\non missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven\nassignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning\nto ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask\noutcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from\nspecific modality observation patterns.

Recent advances in multivariate time series\nanomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model\ninter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).\nDespite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph\nrepresentation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse\nrelationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose\nthe Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD.\nPMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with\na series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph\ncohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function\npromotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable\nlong-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph.

Compared to traditional ML with\nfixed data, designing algorithms in PP converging to a stable point -- known as\na stationary performative stable (SPS) solution -- is more challenging than the\ncounterpart in conventional ML tasks due to the model-induced distribution\nshifts. While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using\nmethods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a\nrecent work established $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS\nsolutions under smooth, non-convex losses. However, this latest progress is\nstill based on the restricted bounded variance assumption in stochastic\ngradient estimates and yields convergence bounds with a non-vanishing error\nneighborhood that scales with the variance. This limitation motivates us to\nimprove convergence rates and reduce error in stochastic optimization for PP,\nparticularly in non-convex settings. Thus, we propose a new algorithm called\nstochastic performative prediction with variance reduction (SPRINT) and\nestablish its convergence to an SPS solution at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$.\nNotably, the resulting error neighborhood is **independent** of the variance of\nthe stochastic gradients.

However, current\nmachine unlearning algorithms are designed to complement the offline training\nparadigm. The emergence of the Continual Learning (CL) paradigm promises\nincremental model updates, enabling models to learn new tasks sequentially.\nNaturally, some of those tasks may need to be unlearned to address safety or\nprivacy concerns that might arise. We find that applying conventional\nunlearning algorithms in continual learning environments creates two critical\nproblems: performance degradation on retained tasks and task relapse, where\npreviously unlearned tasks resurface during subsequent learning. Furthermore,\nmost unlearning algorithms require data to operate, which conflicts with CL's\nphilosophy of discarding past data. A clear need arises for unlearning\nalgorithms that are data-free and mindful of future learning. To that end, we\npropose UnCLe, an Unlearning framework for Continual Learning. UnCLe employs a\nhypernetwork that learns to generate task-specific network parameters, using\ntask embeddings.

In this work, we\npropose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for\nbattery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.\nSeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the\nproposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging\nadaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit\nmodel (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together\nwith the input current to predict voltage.

Latent states need to be estimated\nto align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by\nDA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in\nweather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard\nDA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques,\nor ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a\nmodel-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise.\nIn contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging\nthe model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted,\nmodel-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to\nderive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a\nwell-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others\nholding sufficiently similar opinions.

Although agents seek distinct\nobjectives, collaboration among them can be beneficial in scenarios where\nrelationships between tasks exist. Among the various approaches to promoting\nrelationships between tasks and, consequently, enhancing collaboration between\nagents, one notable method is regularization. While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized\noptimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual\ncosts, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote\npiecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents. Based\non the forward-backward splitting strategy, we propose a decentralized learning\napproach that enables efficient solutions to the regularized optimization\nproblem.

This problem is most\nrelevant to transfer learning under covariate shift. Our framework is built on\nneural network-based generative methods and sample splitting techniques by\ntransforming the conditional distribution testing problem into an unconditional\none. We introduce two special tests: the generative permutation-based\nconditional distribution equality test and the generative classification\naccuracy-based conditional distribution equality test. Theoretically, we\nestablish a minimax lower bound for statistical inference in testing the\nequality of two conditional distributions under certain smoothness conditions.\nWe demonstrate that the generative permutation-based conditional distribution\nequality test and its modified version can attain this lower bound precisely or\nup to some iterated logarithmic factor. Moreover, we prove the testing\nconsistency of the generative classification accuracy-based conditional\ndistribution equality test. We also establish the convergence rate for the\nlearned conditional generator by deriving new results related to the\nrecently-developed offset Rademacher complexity and approximation properties\nusing neural networks.

While efficient, this framework faces two key\nlimitations: First, its binary feedback is too sparse to capture the quality of\nthe reasoning process.

Recently, deep learning architectures have made a\nmajor breakthrough in forecasting the daily average temperature over a ten-day\nhorizon. However, advances in forecasting events related to the maximum\ntemperature over short horizons remain a challenge for the community. A problem\nthat is even more complex consists in making predictions of the maximum daily\ntemperatures in the short, medium, and long term. In this work, we focus on\nforecasting events related to the maximum daily temperature over medium-term\nperiods (90 days). Therefore, instead of addressing the problem from a\nmeteorological point of view, this article tackles it from a climatological\npoint of view. Due to the complexity of this problem, a common approach is to\nframe the study as a temporal classification problem with the classes: maximum\ntemperature \"above normal\", \"normal\" or \"below normal\". From a practical point\nof view, we created a large historical dataset (from 1981 to 2018) collecting\ninformation from weather stations located in South America. In addition, we\nalso integrated exogenous information from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian\nOcean basins. We applied the AutoGluonTS platform to solve the above-mentioned\nproblem. This AutoML tool shows competitive forecasting performance with\nrespect to large operational platforms dedicated to tackling this\nclimatological problem; but with a \"relatively\" low computational cost in terms\nof time and resources."}

In parallel, flatness of the loss\nlandscape has been theoretically and empirically linked to generalization. Yet,\nthe causal role of either phenomenon remains unclear: Are they prerequisites\nfor generalization, or merely by-products of training dynamics? We disentangle\nthese questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization\nprecedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from\ntraining dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative\nflatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently\npredicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing\ngeneralize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions\nexhibit delayed generalization. Furthermore, we show theoretically that neural\ncollapse implies relative flatness under classical assumptions, explaining\ntheir empirical co-occurrence. Our results support the view that relative\nflatness is a potentially necessary and more fundamental property for\ngeneralization, and demonstrate how grokking can serve as a powerful probe for\nisolating its geometric underpinnings."}

It consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine\nmultimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample\npairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal\nrelationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal\ncounterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by\nincorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.\nExtensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships\namong them from multimodal unstructured data."}

This paper bridges these gaps by introducing the first framework for\nworld modeling in remote sensing. We formulate remote sensing world modeling as\ndirection-conditioned spatial extrapolation, where models generate semantically\nconsistent adjacent image tiles given a central observation and directional\ninstruction. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop RSWISE (Remote Sensing\nWorld-Image Spatial Evaluation), a benchmark containing 1,600 evaluation tasks\nacross four scenarios: general, flood, urban, and rural.

In\ncold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet\nlatency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a\nThinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the\nresearch community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we\nfine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which\nproduces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.\nQwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and\nQwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0\nlicense."}

In this work, we propose\nNested Subspace Networks (NSNs), a novel architectural paradigm that enables a\nsingle model to be dynamically and granularly adjusted across a continuous\nspectrum of compute budgets at inference time. The core of our approach is to\nre-parameterize linear layers to satisfy a nested subspace property, such that\nthe function computed at a given rank is a strict subspace of the function at\nany higher rank. We show that this entire hierarchy of models can be optimized\njointly via an uncertainty-aware objective that learns to balance the\ncontributions of different ranks based on their intrinsic difficulty.

Although emerging foundation models aim for broader\napplicability, their rigid dependence on fixed, high-density multi-channel\nmontages restricts their use across heterogeneous datasets and in\nmissing-channel or practical low-channel settings. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce SingLEM, a self-supervised foundation model that\nlearns robust, general-purpose representations from single-channel EEG, making\nit inherently hardware agnostic. The model employs a hybrid encoder\narchitecture that combines convolutional layers to extract local features with\na hierarchical transformer to model both short- and long-range temporal\ndependencies. SingLEM is pretrained on 71 public datasets comprising over 9,200\nsubjects and 357,000 single-channel hours of EEG. When evaluated as a fixed\nfeature extractor across six motor imagery and cognitive tasks, aggregated\nsingle-channel representations consistently outperformed leading multi-channel\nfoundation models and handcrafted baselines. These results demonstrate that a\nsingle-channel approach can achieve state-of-the-art generalization while\nenabling fine-grained neurophysiological analysis and enhancing\ninterpretability.

Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite\nimagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface\nprediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth\nfoundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves\npredictions on three tasks and four datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and\nsoil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its\nability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad\nland-surface applications.

This alternative supervision is appealing\nbecause collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less\nlabor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the\ndevelopment of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this\ndomain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the\nwidely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly\napplied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the\ncomplementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance\nof CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup\n(ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate\nthe noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label\nsharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements\nacross synthetic and real-world labeled datasets.

These snapshots, while lacking temporal ordering, implicitly\nencode the processes that preserve them. This work investigates how strongly\nsuch a distribution constrains its underlying dynamics and how to recover them.\nWe introduce the Equilibrium flow method, a framework that learns continuous\ndynamics that preserve a given pattern distribution. Our method successfully\nidentifies plausible dynamics for 2-D systems and recovers the signature\nchaotic behavior of the Lorenz attractor. For high-dimensional Turing patterns\nfrom the Gray-Scott model, we develop an efficient, training-free variant that\nachieves high fidelity to the ground truth, validated both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. Our analysis reveals the solution space is constrained not only\nby the data but also by the learning model's inductive biases. This capability\nextends beyond recovering known systems, enabling a new paradigm of inverse\ndesign for Artificial Life. By specifying a target pattern distribution, we can\ndiscover the local interaction rules that preserve it, leading to the\nspontaneous emergence of complex behaviors, such as life-like flocking,\nattraction, and repulsion patterns, from simple, user-defined snapshots."}

Traditional BO\nmethods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can\nresult in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is\npoorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO\nwith large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the\ncrossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels\nbased on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the\npower of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to\nselect the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by\nthe Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each\niteration of BO.

However, currently available open-source dLLMs\noften generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at\nevery denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present\nSpiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by\n$\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output\ndistribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying\nideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling\nincreased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup\nachieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel\ndecoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of\nthese methods leading to total speedups of up to $\\mathbf{7.9\\times}$."}

Traditionally,\nengineers depend on audible and visual aids to identify these fractures, as\nthey do not physically dissect the object in question into multiple pieces to\ncheck for inconsistencies. This research introduces ideas towards the\ndevelopment of a robust strategy to image such defects using only a small set\nof minimal, non-invasive measurements.\n  Assuming a one dimensional model (e.g. longitudinal waves in long and thin\nrods/acoustic ducts or transverse vibrations of strings), we make use of the\ncontinuous one-dimensional wave equation to model these physical phenomena and\nthen employ specialized mathematical analysis tools (the Laplace transform and\noptimization) to introduce our defect imaging ideas. In particular, we will\nfocus on the case of a long bar which is homogeneous throughout except in a\nsmall area where a defect in its Young's modulus is present. We will first\ndemonstrate how the problem is equivalent to a spring-mass vibrational system,\nand then show how our imaging strategy makes use of the Laplace domain analytic\nmap between the characteristics of the respective defect and the measurement\ndata.\n  More explicitly, we will utilize MATLAB (a platform for numerical\ncomputations) to collect synthetic data (computational alternative to real\nworld measurements) for several scenarios with one defect of arbitrary location\nand stiffness. Subsequently, we will use this data along with our analytically\ndeveloped map (between defect characteristics and measurements) to construct a\nresidual function which, once optimized, will reveal the location and magnitude\nof the stiffness defect."}

While\ntraditional quantum error correction codes require substantial qubit overhead\nand complex syndrome decoding, we propose a machine learning approach that\ndirectly reconstructs clean quantum states from noisy density matrices without\nadditional qubits. We formulate quantum noise reduction as a supervised\nlearning problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder\narchitecture with a novel fidelity-aware composite loss function. Our method is\ntrained and evaluated on a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 10,000 density\nmatrices derived from random 5-qubit quantum circuits, encompassing five noise\ntypes (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, bit-flip, and mixed\nnoise) across four intensity levels (0.05-0.20). The CNN successfully\nreconstructs quantum states across all noise conditions, achieving an average\nfidelity improvement from 0.298 to 0.774 ({\\Delta} = 0.476). Notably, the model\ndemonstrates superior performance on complex mixed noise scenarios and higher\nnoise intensities, with mixed noise showing the highest corrected fidelity\n(0.807) and improvement (0.567). The approach effectively preserves both\ndiagonal elements (populations) and off-diagonal elements (quantum coherences),\nmaking it suitable for entanglement-dependent quantum algorithms. While phase\ndamping presents fundamental information-theoretic limitations, our results\nsuggest that CNN-based density matrix reconstruction offers a promising,\nresource-efficient alternative to traditional quantum error correction for\nNISQ-era devices. This data-driven approach could enable practical quantum\nadvantage with fewer physical qubits than conventional error correction schemes\nrequire."}

Although PyTorch 2 introduced TorchDynamo and\nTorchInductor to enable just-in-time graph compilation, unresolved dynamic\ncontrol flow and unsupported Python constructs often fragment models into\nmultiple FX graphs. These fragments force frequent fallbacks to eager mode,\nincur costly CPU-to-GPU synchronizations, and reduce optimization\nopportunities. GraphMend addresses this limitation by analyzing and\ntransforming source code before execution. Built on the Jac compilation\nframework, GraphMend introduces two code transformations that remove graph\nbreaks due to dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions. This design allows\nPyTorch's compilation pipeline to capture larger, uninterrupted FX graphs\nwithout requiring manual refactoring by developers. Evaluation across eight\nHugging Face models shows that GraphMend removes all fixable graph breaks due\nto dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions, driving the break count to 0\nin 6 models and reducing it from 5 to 2 in another model. On NVIDIA RTX 3090\nand A40 GPUs, GraphMend achieves up to 75% latency reductions and up to 8%\nhigher end-to-end throughput. These results demonstrate that high-level code\ntransformation is an effective complement to PyTorch's dynamic JIT compilation\npipeline, substantially improving both usability and performance."}

Prior studies have shown\nthat thyroid texture is important for segregating the thyroid ultrasound images\ninto different classes. Based upon our experience with breast cancer\nclassification, we first conjuncture that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)\nis the best descriptor for capturing textural features. Thyroid ultrasound\nimages are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple\ncomplex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence,\nwe second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local\nDCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context.\nAnother disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering\nof ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third\nconjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the\ntextural features and propose the integration of another popular texture\ncapturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT. ILBP is\nknown to be noise resilient as well. We term our novel descriptor as Binary\nPattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform (BPD-LDCT). Final classification\nis carried out using a non-linear SVM. The proposed CAD system is evaluated on\nthe only two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets, namely TDID and AUITD.\nThe evaluation is conducted in two stages.

However, the Euclidean\ngeometry of the embedding space limits the expressive power of DEs, which may\ncompromise their quality. This paper investigates such limitations in the\ncontext of hierarchical retrieval (HR), where the document set has a\nhierarchical structure and the matching documents for a query are all of its\nancestors. We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding\ndimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number\nof documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a\nstandard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and\ndocument pairs. Our experiments reveal a lost-in-the-long-distance phenomenon,\nwhere retrieval accuracy degrades for documents further away in the hierarchy.\nTo address this, we introduce a pretrain-finetune recipe that significantly\nimproves long-distance retrieval without sacrificing performance on closer\ndocuments. We experiment on a realistic hierarchy from WordNet for retrieving\ndocuments at various levels of abstraction, and show that pretrain-finetune\nboosts the recall on long-distance pairs from 19% to 76%.

Unlike state-based RL,\nvision-based RL is much more memory inefficient, resulting in relatively low\nbatch sizes, which is not amenable for algorithms like PPO. Nevertheless, it is\nstill an attractive method as unlike the more commonly used techniques which\ndistill state-based policies into vision networks, end-to-end RL can allow for\nemergent active vision behaviors. We identify a key bottleneck in training\nthese policies is the way most existing simulators scale to multiple GPUs using\ntraditional data parallelism techniques. We propose a new method where we\ndisaggregate the simulator and RL (both training and experience buffers) onto\nseparate GPUs. On a node with four GPUs, we have the simulator running on three\nof them, and PPO running on the fourth. We are able to show that with the same\nnumber of GPUs, we can double the number of existing environments compared to\nthe previous baseline of standard data parallelism. This allows us to train\nvision-based environments, end-to-end with depth, which were previously\nperforming far worse with the baseline. We train and distill both depth and\nstate-based policies into stereo RGB networks and show that depth distillation\nleads to better results, both in simulation and reality. This improvement is\nlikely due to the observability gap between state and vision policies which\ndoes not exist when distilling depth policies into stereo RGB. We further show\nthat the increased batch size brought about by disaggregated simulation also\nimproves real world performance. When deploying in the real world, we improve\nupon the previous state-of-the-art vision-based results using our end-to-end\npolicies."}

In the latter, we investigate how the constraints\nand structure of smart grids, spanning energy, communication, and regulatory\ndimensions, shape the design, training, and deployment of M3T FedFMs."}

Starting with 8 million\ndocuments, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of\nroughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the\ndataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the\npages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up\nmore than 25% of the dataset.\n  In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors,\nFFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on\nthe CommonForms test set.

Is a given set\nof rules exhaustive in the sense that for every input the output is determined?\nFinding algorithms that extract such rules out of networks has been\ninvestigated over the last 30 years, however, to the author's current\nknowledge, no attempt in verification was made until now. A lot of attempts of\nextracting rules use heuristics involving randomness and over-approximation, so\nit might be beneficial to know whether knowledge obtained in that way can\nactually be trusted.\n  We investigate the above questions for neural networks with ReLU-activation\nas well as for Boolean networks, each for several types of rules. We\ndemonstrate how these problems can be reduced to each other and show that most\nof them are co-NP-complete."}

I2S utilizes handcrafted features extracted from 3D hand poses and per\nforms sequential feature augmentation: first identifying the object class,\nfollowed by HOI recognition, and ultimately, user identification. A\ncomprehensive feature extraction and description process was carried out for 3D\nhand poses, organizing the extracted features into semantically meaningful\ncategories: Spatial, Frequency, Kinematic, Orientation, and a novel descriptor\nintroduced in this work, the Inter-Hand Spatial Envelope (IHSE).

In our evaluation of widely used coding\nmodels, under a unified scaffold, we observe that their performance on\nSWE-Bench PRO remains below 25% (Pass@1), with GPT-5 achieving the highest\nscore to date at 23.3%. To better understand these limitations, we cluster the\nfailure modes observed in the collected agent trajectories for a clearer\ncharacterization of the error patterns exhibited by current models. Overall,\nSWE-BENCH PRO provides a contamination-resistant testbed that more faithfully\ncaptures the complexity and diversity of real-world software development,\nadvancing the pursuit of truly autonomous software engineering agents at a\nprofessional level."}

Our contributions are threefold.

Prototype-based modeling has shown promise for interpretability by\ngrounding predictions in semantically meaningful regions for purely visual\nreasoning tasks, yet remains underexplored in the context of VQA. We present\nProtoVQA, a unified prototypical framework that (i) learns question-aware\nprototypes that serve as reasoning anchors, connecting answers to\ndiscriminative image regions, (ii) applies spatially constrained matching to\nensure that the selected evidence is coherent and semantically relevant, and\n(iii) supports both answering and grounding tasks through a shared prototype\nbackbone. To assess explanation quality, we propose the Visual-Linguistic\nAlignment Score (VLAS), which measures how well the model's attended regions\nalign with ground-truth evidence.

Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes,\ntextures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to\nsynthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU\nconfigurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of\npain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain\nexpression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and\nethnicity.\n  We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal\ndistillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student\ntrained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical\nreliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse,\nand clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment."}

One of the main disadvantages of this method is\nthe high computational cost and memory requirements. Since an exhaustive search\nis not feasible in large data stores, practitioners commonly use approximate\n$k$-NN MT lookup, yet even such algorithms are a bottleneck. In contrast to\nresearch directions seeking to accelerate $k$-NN MT by reducing data store size\nor the number of lookup calls, we pursue an orthogonal direction based on the\nperformance properties of approximate $k$-NN MT lookup data structures. In\nparticular, we propose to encourage angular dispersion of the neural hidden\nrepresentations of contexts.

Source Code will be released in the next\n  version", "summary": "Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories\nwhile retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show\npromising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply\nlightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby\ncompromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter\ndrift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns\nlearned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is\nnot always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned\nfrom pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing\nappropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a\nmargin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for\nCIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to\nmitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks.\nSpecifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of\nnew tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture\nof different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the\nintermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly\noutstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings.

Researchers have\nattempted to tackle this issue by using pre-trained contextualized language\nmodels such as BERT. However, these models are often based on fact-based data,\nwhich can introduce bias in domain-specific tasks like ABSA. To our knowledge,\nno studies have applied adaptive pre-training with Arabic contextualized models\nfor ABSA.

We examine fine-tuning strategies - feature\nextraction, full fine-tuning, and adapter-based methods - to enhance\nperformance and efficiency, utilizing multiple adaptation corpora and\ncontextualized models. Our results show that in-domain adaptive pre-training\nyields modest improvements. Adapter-based fine-tuning is a computationally\nefficient method that achieves competitive results.

Because computing the SRE\nfor arbitrary quantum states is a computationally hard problem, we propose a\nsupervised machine-learning approach to estimate it. In this work, we frame SRE\nestimation as a regression task and train a Random Forest Regressor and a\nSupport Vector Regressor (SVR) on a comprehensive dataset, including both\nunstructured random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the\nphysics-motivated one-dimensional transverse Ising model (TIM). We compare the\nmachine-learning models using two different quantum circuit representations:\none based on classical shadows and the other on circuit-level features.\nFurthermore, we assess the generalization capabilities of the models on\nout-of-distribution instances. Experimental results show that an SVR trained on\ncircuit-level features achieves the best overall performance. On the random\ncircuits dataset, our approach converges to accurate SRE estimations, but\nstruggles to generalize out of distribution. In contrast, it generalizes well\non the structured TIM dataset, even to deeper and larger circuits. In line with\nprevious work, our experiments suggest that machine learning offers a viable\npath for efficient nonstabilizerness estimation."}

In this thesis, I will\ndiscuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2)\nrehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity,\nrespectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but\ntactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical\nworld, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of\ncontact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only\nexploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning\nto make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand,\nrehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the\nsignificant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at\nscale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical\nschool and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand\northosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and\nuses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the\northosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment.\nMy work develops machine learning algorithms that enable intent inferral with\nminimal data, including semi-supervised, meta-learning, and generative AI\nmethods."}

A\nkey challenge is to assess input adequacy in a way that reflects the demands of\nthe task, ideally before even generating any output. We introduce CLOTHO, a\ntask-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty\ndirectly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a\nspecific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample\nthe most informative cases for human labelling.

For example,\n\"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road\" consists\nof two specifications: \"overtake the pedestrian\" and \"walk on the right side of\nthe road.\" To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the\nintuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its\nconstituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.\nUsing diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then\ncomposes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of\nspecifications unseen in training.

In this expository note, we give an overview of some\ntopics at the interface of tame geometry (also known as o-minimality),\noptimization theory, and deep learning theory and practice. To do so, we\ngradually introduce the concepts and tools used to build convergence guarantees\nfor stochastic gradient descent in a general nonsmooth nonconvex, but tame,\nsetting. This illustrates some ways in which tame geometry is a natural\nmathematical framework for the study of AI systems, especially within Deep\nLearning."}

Losey"], "title": "Prepare Before You Act: Learning From Humans to Rearrange Initial States", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.LG", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "comment": null, "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective across a wide range of\nmanipulation tasks. However, IL policies often struggle when faced with\nout-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a\npreviously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases,\nextensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and\ngeneralizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical\ninitial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task\nexecution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier\nto grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp\ntheir target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same\ncapability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their\ngiven policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which\nare outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses\nso that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we\nshow that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out\nthe given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET\nalgorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic\nteleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what\nsimplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into\nrobot action primitives. Comparisons with diffusion policies, VLAs, and other\nbaselines show that using ReSET to prepare the environment enables more robust\ntask execution with equal amounts of total training data.

We identify three specific advantages of the Functional\nEffects Model over traditional fixed, and random/mixed effects models: (i) by\nmapping individual-specific effects as a function of socio-demographic\nvariables, we can account for these effects when forecasting choices of\npreviously unobserved individuals (ii) the (approximate) maximum-likelihood\nestimation of functional effects avoids the incidental parameters problem of\nthe fixed effects model, even when the number of observed choices per\nindividual is small; and (iii) we do not rely on the strong distributional\nassumptions of the random effects model, which may not match reality. We learn\nfunctional intercept and functional slopes with powerful non-linear machine\nlearning regressors for tabular data, namely gradient boosting decision trees\nand deep neural networks. We validate our proposed methodology on a synthetic\nexperiment and three real-world panel case studies, demonstrating that the\nFunctional Effects Model: (i) can identify the true values of\nindividual-specific effects when the data generation process is known; (ii)\noutperforms both state-of-the-art ML choice modelling techniques that omit\nindividual heterogeneity in terms of predictive performance, as well as\ntraditional static panel choice models in terms of learning inter-individual\nheterogeneity. The results indicate that the FI-RUMBoost model, which combines\nthe individual-specific constants of the Functional Effects Model with the\ncomplex, non-linear utilities of RUMBoost, performs marginally best on\nlarge-scale revealed preference panel data."}

The performance of a given algorithm\ndepends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and\nconstraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to\nguide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a\nnew recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a\nKnowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To\naddress this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published\nliterature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to\ngather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct\napproaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based\nsearch, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized\nby a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with\ndata-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a\ncommercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a\nseries of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy\nand reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better\nthan the commercial LLM chatbot."}

Reinforcement\nlearning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic\nprogramming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial\noptimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth\nof the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy\nconcerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper\nproposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel\napproach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based\non a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to\ngroup possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent\nbehavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning\nlayer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents\nwith minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and\nreal-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and\ndrone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance,\nscalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective\nlearning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution."}
