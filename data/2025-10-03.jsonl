However, their exponentially\nincreasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints.

The submission\n  includes 10 pages and 6 figures", "summary": "Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,\nincluding safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased\nmaintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our\nknowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety\nchallenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution."}

In large language models,\nsemantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,\nwhile episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers\ntend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this\nphenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,\nentropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall\nbehavior.

The submission\n  includes 10 pages and 6 figures", "summary": "Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,\nincluding safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased\nmaintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our\nknowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety\nchallenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution."}

Consequently, methods that naively apply\nimage-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally\ninconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent\nadvances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent\ndiffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal\ncausality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot\nor plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with\npriors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for\nautomatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction\nquality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong\nmeasurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.\nExtensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show\nsignificant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that\napply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both\nreconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency."}

In large language models,\nsemantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,\nwhile episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers\ntend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this\nphenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,\nentropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall\nbehavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and\nmonotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable\nacross various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the\nscore interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the\npenalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly\nestimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),\nyielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled\nboth semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical\nminimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,\nthe model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic\ncontinuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory\naging.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B\nachieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens\nversus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B\nfurther reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and\n57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable\neven at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and\nhardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance\nlanguage stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages."}

However, this approach suffers from reward\nhacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate\nsignificantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization\nis insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit\nimage-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward\nhAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method.

These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,\nand interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS\n23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).\n  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping\nstandards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are\ninstantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic\nrepresentation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.\nWe create \"functional location tags\" as OWL individuals that become instances\nof OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create\ninstances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated\nvalidation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.\nUsing semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether\nthe product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable\nIDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to\nbe applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of\nthis approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart\nStandards."}

After training on open-source\ndata with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability\nand performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,\nachieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about\nthree percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without\nadditional tricks.

While\ntext-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as\nweb search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend\ntool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that\ntool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting\nconversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived\nlatency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before\nthe user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline\nthat teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how\nto generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text\nresults, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our\napproach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries\nfrom the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%\nrelative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by\nreducing tool use latency by 20%.

In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space.

(2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space.

(2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

Considering the social impact of AI\nsystems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As\nevidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust\nrepresentations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing\nalgorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for\nprediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that\nutilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior\nrobustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing\ninterest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in\nthese learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we\nintroduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address\nbias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically\nselecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data.

To address the\nmethodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight\nspace backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We\ndemonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging\nFace achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on\nlaboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the\nmodel weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize\nto unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space\nrepresentations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are\nnot indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by\nthe weight space learning community."}

This paper\ninvestigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological\ncounseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's\nability to function as a counselor.

Our\napproach is applicable to both classification and generative models.\nExperiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image\ngeneration show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest\nbaselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image\ngeneration.

The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis\n(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in\nchoosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior\nknowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often\nunavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are\nsignificantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked\nimprovements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,\nand local intrinsic dimension estimation."}

This fine-tuning protocol yields\nsignificantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in\nterms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance\npartitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance\nwith language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured\nby the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find\nthat human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective\nattributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the\npretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video\nmodels' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning\nshapes video representations toward human social perception."}

The aim of this\npaper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing\ncategorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also\npropose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which\nprovide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our\nresults on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of\ncategorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform\nall competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior\nknowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using\ntarget encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of\ndatasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this\nestimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low\ncomputational cost."}

User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on\na coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a\nfine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as\nhaving scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively\nif the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on\nthe total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores\nand the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally\npartitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside\neach bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can\nbe queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a\nnear-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\\Theta(n^2)$\nusers (and therefore $\\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than\nthe $O(n\\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the\nadditional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate\nthresholds.

Extensive\nexperiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with\na 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on\nout-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and\nenabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our\nmethod achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more\npowerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate\na more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO."}

To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token\nEntropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration\nthroughout the reasoning process.

With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow\nmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly\nstronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization\nadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving\nbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.\nFor evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)\nfeaturing region-level dragging instructions.

To address more effective reasoning, we\nintroduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of\nprocedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning\nsuccessful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple\nabstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a\nsolution while using the information provided by these abstractions.
